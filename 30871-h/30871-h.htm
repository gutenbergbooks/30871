<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Although</span> the folk-tales and legends of
Brittany have received ample attention from
native scholars and collectors, they have not
as yet been presented in a popular manner to English-speaking
readers. The probable reasons for what
would appear to be an otherwise incomprehensible
omission on the part of those British writers who
make a popular use of legendary material are that
many Breton folk-tales strikingly resemble those of
other countries, that from a variety of considerations
some of them are unsuitable for presentation in an
English dress, and that most of the folk-tales proper
certainly possess a strong family likeness to one
another.</p>
<p>But it is not the folk-tale alone which goes to make up
the romantic literary output of a people; their ballads,
the heroic tales which they have woven around passages
in their national history, their legends (employing
the term in its proper sense), along with the more
literary attempts of their romance-weavers, their beliefs
regarding the supernatural, the tales which cluster
around their ancient homes and castles&mdash;all of these,
although capable of separate classification, are akin to
folk-lore, and I have not, therefore, hesitated to use
what in my discretion I consider the best out of immense
stores of material as being much more suited to
supply British readers with a comprehensive view of
Breton story. Thus, I have included chapters on the
lore which cleaves to the ancient stone monuments
of the country, along with some account of the monuments
themselves. The Arthurian matter especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
connected with Brittany I have relegated to a separate
chapter, and I have considered it only fitting to include
such of the <i>lais</i> of that rare and human songstress
Marie de France as deal with the Breton land. The
legends of those sainted men to whom Brittany owes
so much will be found in a separate chapter, in collecting
the matter for which I have obtained the kindest
assistance from Miss Helen Macleod Scott, who has
the preservation of the Celtic spirit so much at heart.
I have also included chapters on the interesting theme
of the black art in Brittany, as well as on the several
species of fays and demons which haunt its moors and
forests; nor will the heroic tales of its great warriors
and champions be found wanting. To assist the reader
to obtain the atmosphere of Brittany and in order
that he may read these tales without feeling that he is
perusing matter relating to a race of which he is otherwise
ignorant, I have afforded him a slight sketch of
the Breton environment and historical development,
and in an attempt to lighten his passage through the
volume I have here and there told a tale in verse,
sometimes translated, sometimes original.</p>
<p>As regards the folk-tales proper, by which I mean
stories collected from the peasantry, I have made a
selection from the works of Gaidoz, SÃ©billot, and Luzel.
In no sense are these translations; they are rather
adaptations. The profound inequality between Breton
folk-tales is, of course, very marked in a collection of
any magnitude, but as this volume is not intended to be
exhaustive I have had no difficulty in selecting material
of real interest. Most of these tales were collected by
Breton folk-lorists in the eighties of the last century,
and the native shrewdness and common sense which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
characterize much of the editors&rsquo; comments upon the
stories so carefully gathered from peasants and fishermen
make them deeply interesting.</p>
<p>It is with a sense of shortcoming that I offer the reader
this volume on a great subject, but should it succeed
in stimulating interest in Breton story, and in directing
students to a field in which their research is certain to be
richly rewarded, I shall not regret the labour and time
which I have devoted to my task.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I: THE LAND, THE PEOPLE AND THEIR STORY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> romantic region which we are about to
traverse in search of the treasures of legend
was in ancient times known as Armorica, a
Latinized form of the Celtic name, Armor (&lsquo;On the
Sea&rsquo;). The Brittany of to-day corresponds to the
departments of FinistÃ¨re, CÃ´tes-du-Nord, Morbihan,
Ille-et-Vilaine, and Loire-InfÃ©rieure. A popular division
of the country is that which partitions it into
Upper, or Eastern, and Lower, or Western, Brittany,
and these tracts together have an area of some 13,130
square miles.</p>
<p>Such parts of Brittany as are near to the sea-coast
present marked differences to the inland regions, where
raised plateaux are covered with dreary and unproductive
moorland. These plateaux, again, rise into small
ranges of hills, not of any great height, but, from
their wild and rugged appearance, giving the impression
of an altitude much loftier than they possess.
The coast-line is ragged, indented, and inhospitable,
lined with deep reefs and broken by the estuaries of
brawling rivers. In the southern portion the district
known as &lsquo;the Emerald Coast&rsquo; presents an almost subtropical
appearance; the air is mild and the whole region
pleasant and fruitful. But with this exception Brittany
is a country of bleak shores and grey seas, barren moorland
and dreary horizons, such a land as legend loves,
such a region, cut off and isolated from the highways
of humanity, as the discarded genii of ancient faiths
might seek as a last stronghold.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the race which peoples this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
secluded peninsula there are no wide differences of
opinion. If we take the word &lsquo;Celt&rsquo; as describing any
branch of the many divergent races which came under
the influence of one particular type of culture, the true
originators of which were absorbed among the folk they
governed and instructed before the historic era, then
the Bretons are &lsquo;Celts&rsquo; indeed, speaking the tongue
known as &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo; for want of a more specific name,
exhibiting marked signs of the possession of &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo;
customs, and having those racial characteristics which
the science of anthropology until recently laid down as
certain indications of &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo; relationship&mdash;the short,
round skull, swarthy complexion, and blue or grey eyes.</p>
<p>It is to be borne in mind, however, that the title
&lsquo;Celtic&rsquo; is shared by the Bretons with the fair or
rufous Highlander of Scotland, the dark Welshman, and
the long-headed Irishman. But the Bretons exhibit
such special characteristics as would warrant the new
anthropology in labelling them the descendants of that
&lsquo;Alpine&rsquo; race which existed in Central Europe in
Neolithic times, and which, perhaps, possessed distant
Mongoloid affinities. This people spread into nearly
all parts of Europe, and later in some regions acquired
Celtic speech and custom from a Celtic aristocracy.</p>
<p>It is remarkable how completely this Celtic leaven&mdash;the
true history of which is lost in the depths of
prehistoric darkness&mdash;succeeded in impressing not
only its language but its culture and spirit upon the
various peoples with whom it came into contact. To
impose a special type of civilization upon another
race must always prove a task of almost superhuman
proportions. To compel the use of an alien tongue
by a conquered folk necessitates racial tact as well as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
strength of purpose. But to secure the adoption of
the racial <i>spirit</i> by the conquered, and adherence
to it for centuries, so that men of widely divergent
origins shall all have the same point of view,
the same mode of thought, manner of address, aye,
even the same <i>facies</i> or general racial appearance, as
have Bretons, some Frenchmen, Cornishmen, Welshmen,
and Highlanders&mdash;that surely would argue an
indwelling racial strength such as not even the Roman
or any other world-empire might pretend to.</p>
<p>But this Celtic civilization was not one and undivided.
In late prehistoric times it evolved from one mother
tongue two dialects which afterward displayed all the
differences of separate languages springing from a
common stock. These are the Goidelic, the tongue
spoken by the Celts of Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle
of Man, and the Brythonic, the language of the Welsh,
the Cornish, and the people of Brittany.</p>
<h3><i>The Breton Tongue</i></h3>
<p>The Brezonek, the Brythonic tongue of Brittany, is
undoubtedly the language of those Celtic immigrants
who fled from Britain the Greater to Britain the Less
to escape the rule of the Saxon invaders, and who gave
the name of the country which they had left to that
Armorica in which they settled. In the earliest stages
of development it is difficult to distinguish Breton from
Welsh. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries the
Breton language is described as &lsquo;Old Breton.&rsquo; &lsquo;Middle
Breton&rsquo; flourished from the eleventh to the seventeenth
centuries, since when &lsquo;Modern Breton&rsquo; has been in
use. These stages indicate changes in the language
more or less profound, due chiefly to admixture with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
French. Various distinct dialects are indicated by writers
on the subject, but the most marked difference in Breton
speech seems to be that between the dialect of Vannes
and that of the rest of Brittany. Such differences do
not appear to be older than the sixteenth century.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<h3><i>The Ancient Armoricans</i></h3>
<p>The written history of Brittany opens with the account
of Julius C&aelig;sar. At that period (57 <span class='smcaplc'>B.C.</span>) Armorica was
inhabited by five principal tribes: the Namnetes, the
Veneti, the Osismii, the Curiosolit&aelig;, and the Redones.
These offered a desperate resistance to Roman encroachment,
but were subdued, and in some cases their
people were sold wholesale into slavery. In 56 <span class='smcaplc'>B.C.</span>
the Veneti threw off the yoke and retained two of
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s officers as hostages. C&aelig;sar advanced upon
Brittany in person, but found that he could make no
headway while he was opposed by the powerful fleet
of flat-bottomed boats, like floating castles, which the
Veneti were so skilful in man&oelig;uvring. Ships were
hastily constructed upon the waters of the Loire, and
a desperate naval engagement ensued, probably in the
Gulf of Morbihan, which resulted in the decisive defeat
of the Veneti, the Romans resorting to the stratagem
of cutting down the enemy&rsquo;s rigging with sickles bound
upon long poles. The members of the Senate of the
conquered people were put to death as a punishment
for their defection, and thousands of the tribesmen
went to swell the slave-markets of Europe.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>Between <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 450 and 500, when the Roman power
and population were dwindling, many vessels brought
fugitives from Britain to Armorica. These people, fleeing
from the conquering barbarians, Saxons, Picts,
and Scots, sought as asylum a land where a kindred
race had not yet been disturbed by invasion. Says
Thierry, in his <i>Norman Conquest</i>: &ldquo;With the consent
of the ancient inhabitants, who acknowledged them as
brethren of the same origin, the new settlers distributed
themselves over the whole northern coast, as far as
the little river Coesoron, and southward as far as the
territory of the city of the Veneti, now called Vannes.
In this extent of country they founded a sort of separate
state, comprising all the small places near the coast,
but not including within its limits the great towns of
Vannes, Nantes, and Rennes. The increase of the population
of this western corner of the country, and the
great number of people of the Celtic race and language
thus assembled within a narrow space, preserved it from
the irruption of the Roman tongue, which, under forms
more or less corrupted, was gradually becoming prevalent
in every other part of Gaul. The name of <i>Brittany</i>
was attached to these coasts, and the names of the
various indigenous tribes disappeared; while the island
which had borne this name for so many ages now lost
it, and, taking the name of its conquerors, began to be
called the land of the Saxons and Angles, or, in one
word, <i>England</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>Samson</i></h3>
<p>One of these British immigrants was the holy Samson,
who laboured to convert pagan Brittany to Christianity.
He hailed from Pembrokeshire, and the legend relates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
that his parents, being childless, constructed a menhir<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
of pure silver and gave it to the poor in the hope
that a son might be born to them. Their desire was
fulfilled, and Samson, the son in question, became a
great missionary of the Church. Accompanied by forty
monks, he crossed the Channel and landed on the
shores of the Bay of Saint-Brieuc, a savage and
deserted district.</p>
<p>As the keel of his galley grated on the beach the Saint
beheld a man on the shore seated at the door of a
miserable hut, who endeavoured to attract his attention
by signs. Samson approached the shore-dweller, who
took him by the hand and, leading him into the
wretched dwelling, showed him his wife and daughter,
stricken with sickness. Samson relieved their pain,
and the husband and father, who, despite his humble
appearance, was chief of the neighbouring territory,
gave him a grant of land hard by. Here, close to the
celebrated menhir of Dol, he and his monks built their
cells. Soon a chapel rose near the ancient seat of pagan
worship&mdash;in later days the site of a great cathedral.</p>
<p>Telio, a British monk, with the assistance of St
Samson, planted near Dol an orchard three miles in
length, and to him is attributed the introduction of the
apple-tree into Brittany. Wherever the monks went
they cultivated the soil; all had in their mouths the
words of the Apostle: &ldquo;If any would not work, neither
should he eat.&rdquo; The people admired the industry of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
the new-comers, and from admiration they passed to
imitation. The peasants joined the monks in tilling
the ground, and even the brigands from the hills and
forests became agriculturists. &ldquo;The Cross and the
plough, labour and prayer,&rdquo; was the motto of these
early missionaries.</p>
<h3><i>Wax for Wine</i></h3>
<p>The monks of Dol were renowned bee-farmers, as we
learn from an anecdote told by Count Montalembert
in his <i>Moines d&rsquo;Occident</i>. One day when St Samson
of Dol, and St Germain, Bishop of Paris, were conversing
on the respective merits of their monasteries, St
Samson said that his monks were such good and careful
preservers of their bees that, besides the honey
which the bees yielded in abundance, they furnished
more wax than was used in the churches for candles
during the year, but that the climate not being suitable
for the growth of vines, there was great scarcity of
wine. Upon hearing this St Germain replied: &ldquo;We,
on the contrary, produce more wine than we can consume,
but we have to buy wax; so, if you will furnish
us with wax, we will give you a tenth of our wine.&rdquo;
Samson accepted this offer, and the mutual arrangement
was continued during the lives of the two saints.</p>
<p>Two British kingdoms were formed in Armorica&mdash;Domnonia
and Cornubia. The first embraced the
CÃ´tes-du-Nord and FinistÃ¨re north of the river Ãlorn,
Cornubia, or Cornouaille, as it is now known, being
situated below that river, as far south as the river EllÃ©.
At first these states paid a nominal homage to their
native kings in Britain, but on the final fall of the
British power they proclaimed a complete independence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<h3><i>The Vision of Jud-Hael</i></h3>
<p>A striking story relating to the migration period is told
concerning a Cambrian chieftain of Brittany, one Jud-Hael,
and the famous British bard Taliesin. Shortly
after the arrival of Taliesin in Brittany Jud-Hael had
a remarkable vision. He dreamt that he saw a high
mountain, on the summit of which was placed a lofty
column fixed deeply in the earth, with a base of ivory,
and branches which reached to the heavens. The
lower part was iron, brilliantly polished, and to it were
attached rings of the same metal, from which were
suspended cuirasses, casques, lances, javelins, bucklers,
trumpets, and many other warlike trophies. The upper
portion was of gold, and upon it hung candelabra,
censers, stoles, chalices, and ecclesiastical symbols of
every description. As the Prince stood admiring the
spectacle the heavens opened and a maiden of marvellous
beauty descended and approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I salute you, O Jud-Hael,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I confide
to your keeping for a season this column and all that it
supports&rdquo;; and with these words she vanished.</p>
<p>On the following day Jud-Hael made public his dream,
but, like Nebuchadnezzar of old, he could find no one
to interpret it, so he turned to the bard Taliesin as to
another Daniel. Taliesin, says the legend, then an
exile from his native land of Britain, dwelt on the seashore.
To him came the messenger of Jud-Hael and
said: &ldquo;O thou who so truly dost interpret all things
ambiguous, hear and make clear the strange vision
which my lord hath seen.&rdquo; He then recounted Jud-Hael&rsquo;s
dream to the venerable bard.</p>
<p>For a time the sage sat pondering deeply, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
replied: &ldquo;Thy master reigneth well and wisely, O
messenger, but he has a son who will reign still more
happily even than himself, and who will become one of
the greatest men in the Breton land. The sons of his
loins will be the fathers of powerful counts and pious
Churchmen, but he himself, the greatest man of that
race, shall be first a valiant warrior and later a mighty
champion of heaven. The earlier part of his life
shall be given to the world; the latter portion shall
be devoted to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophecy of Taliesin was duly fulfilled. For Judik-Hael,
the son of Jud-Hael, realized the bard&rsquo;s prediction,
and entered the cloister after a glorious reign.</p>
<h3><i>Taliesin</i></h3>
<p>Taliesin (&lsquo;Shining Forehead&rsquo;) was in the highest
repute in the middle of the twelfth century, and he was
then and afterward, unless we except Merlin, the bardic
hero of the greatest number of romantic legends. He
is said to have been the son of Henwg the bard, or
St Henwg, of Caerleon-upon-Usk, and to have been
educated in the school of Cattwg, at Llanvithin, in
Glamorgan, where the historian Gildas was his fellow-pupil.
Seized when a youth by Irish pirates, he is
said, probably by rational interpretation of a later fable
of his history, to have escaped by using a wooden
buckler for a boat. Thus he came into the fishing weir
of Elphin, one of the sons of Urien. Urien made him
Elphin&rsquo;s instructor, and gave him an estate of land.
But, once introduced into the Court of that great warrior-chief,
Taliesin became his foremost bard, followed him
in his wars, and sang his victories. He celebrates triumphs
over Ida, the Anglian King of Bernicia (<i>d.</i> 559)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
at Argoed about the year 547, at Gwenn-Estrad between
that year and 559, at Menao about the year 559.
After the death of Urien, Taliesin was the bard of his
son Owain, by whose hand Ida fell. After the death of
all Urien&rsquo;s sons Taliesin retired to mourn the downfall
of his race in Wales, dying, it is said, at Bangor Teivi,
in Cardiganshire. He was buried under a cairn near
Aberystwyth.</p>
<h3><i>HervÃ© the Blind</i></h3>
<p>There is nothing improbable in the statement that
Taliesin dwelt in Brittany in the sixth century. Many
other British bards found a refuge on the shores of
Britain the Less. Among these was Kyvarnion, a
Christian, who married a Breton Druidess and who had
a son, HervÃ©. HervÃ© was blind from birth, and was
led from place to place by a wolf which he had converted
(!) and pressed into the service of Mother Church.</p>
<p>One day, when a lad, HervÃ© had been left in charge of
his uncle&rsquo;s farm, when a ploughman passed him in full
flight, crying out that a savage wolf had appeared and
had killed the ass with which he had been ploughing.
The man entreated HervÃ© to fly, as the wolf was hard
upon his heels; but the blind youth, undaunted, ordered
the terrified labourer to seize the animal and harness it
to the plough with the harness of the dead ass. From
that time the wolf dwelt among the sheep and goats on
the farm, and subsisted upon hay and grass.</p>
<h3><i>NomenoÃ«</i></h3>
<p>Swarms of Irish from Ossory and Wexford began to
arrive about the close of the fifth century, settling along
the west and north coasts. The immigrants from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Britain the Greater formed by degrees the counties
of Vannes, Cornouaille, LÃ©on, and DomnonÃ©e, constituted
a powerful aristocracy, and initiated a long and
arduous struggle against the Frankish monarchs, who
exercised a nominal suzerainty over Brittany. Louis
the Pious placed a native chief, NomenoÃ«, at the head
of the province, and a long period of peace ensued.
But in <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 845 NomenoÃ« revolted against Charles the
Bald, defeated him, and forced him to recognize the
independence of Brittany, and to forgo the annual
tribute which he had exacted. A ballad by VillemarquÃ©
describes the incident. Like Macpherson, who in his
enthusiasm for the fragments of Ossianic lore &lsquo;reconstructed&rsquo;
them only too well, VillemarquÃ© unfortunately
tampered very freely with such matter as he collected,
and it may even be that the poem on NomenoÃ«, for
which he claims authority, is altogether spurious, as
some critics consider. But as it affords a spirited picture
of the old Breton chief the story is at least worth relating.</p>
<p>The poem describes how an aged chieftain waits on the
hills of Retz for his son, who has gone over to Rennes
to pay the Breton tribute to the Franks. Many chariots
drawn by horses has he taken with him, but although
a considerable time has elapsed there is no indication
of his return. The chieftain climbs to an eminence in
the hope of discerning his son in the far distance, but
no sign of his appearance is to be seen on the long white
road or on the bleak moors which fringe it.</p>
<p>The anxious father espies a merchant wending slowly
along the highway and hails him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, good merchant, you who travel the land from end
to end, have you seen aught of my son Karo, who
has gone to conduct the tribute chariots to Rennes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/gs02.jpg' alt='' title='' width='406' height='600' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
NOMENOÃ<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! chieftain, if your son has gone with the tribute
it is in vain you wait for him, for the Franks found
it not enough, and have weighed his head against it
in the balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father gazes wildly at the speaker, sways, and
falls heavily with a doleful cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karo, my son! My lost Karo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene changes to the fortress of NomenoÃ«, and
we see its master returning from the chase, accompanied
by his great hounds and laden with trophies. His bow
is in his hand, and he carries the carcass of a boar
upon his shoulder. The red blood drops from the
dead beast&rsquo;s mouth and stains his hand. The aged
chief, well-nigh demented, awaits his coming, and
NomenoÃ« greets him courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, honest mountaineer!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;What is your
news? What would you with NomenoÃ«?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come for justice, Lord NomenoÃ«,&rdquo; replies the aged
man. &ldquo;Is there a God in heaven and a chief in
Brittany? There is a God above us, I know, and I
believe there is a just Duke in the Breton land. Mighty
ruler, make war upon the Frank, defend our country,
and give us vengeance&mdash;vengeance for Karo my son,
Karo, slain, decapitated by the Frankish barbarians,
his beauteous head made into a balance-weight for
their brutal sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man weeps, and the tears flow down his grizzled
beard.</p>
<p>Then NomenoÃ« rises in anger and swears a great oath.
&ldquo;By the head of this boar, and by the arrow which
slew him,&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;I will not wash this blood from
off my hand until I free the country from mine enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NomenoÃ« has gone to the seashore and gathered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
pebbles, for these are the tribute he intends to offer
the bald King.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Arrived at the gates of Rennes, he
asks that they shall be opened to him so that he
may pay the tribute of silver. He is asked to descend,
to enter the castle, and to leave his chariot in the
courtyard. He is requested to wash his hands to the
sound of a horn before eating (an ancient custom), but
he replies that he prefers to deliver the tribute-money
there and then. The sacks are weighed, and the third
is found light by several pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, what is this?&rdquo; cries the Frankish castellan. &ldquo;This
sack is under weight, Sir NomenoÃ«.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out leaps NomenoÃ«&rsquo;s sword from the scabbard, and
the Frank&rsquo;s head is smitten from his shoulders. Then,
seizing it by its gory locks, the Breton chief with a
laugh of triumph casts it into the balance. His warriors
throng the courtyard, the town is taken; young Karo
is avenged!</p>
<h3><i>Alain Barbe-torte</i></h3>
<p>The end of the ninth century and the beginning of the
tenth were remarkable for the invasions of the Northmen.
On several occasions they were driven back&mdash;by
Salomon (<i>d.</i> 874), by Alain, Count of Vannes
(<i>d.</i> 907)&mdash;but it was Alain Barbe-torte, &lsquo;Alain of the
Twisted Beard,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Alain the Fox&rsquo; (<i>d.</i> 952), who
gained the decisive victory over them, and concerning
him an ancient ballad has much to say. It was taken
down by VillemarquÃ© from the lips of a peasant, an
old soldier of the Chouan leader Georges Cadoudal.</p>
<p>In his youth Alain was a mighty hunter of the bear
and the boar in the forests of his native Brittany, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the courage gained in this manly sport stood him in
good stead when he came to employ it against the
enemies of his country, the hated Northmen. Rallying
the Bretons who lurked in the forests or hid in the
mountain fastnesses, he led them against the enemy,
whom he surprised near Dol in the middle of the night,
making a great carnage among them. After this battle
the Scandinavian invaders were finally expelled from
the Breton land and Alain was crowned King or Arch-chief
in 937.</p>
<p>A free translation of this ballad might run as follows:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Lurks the Fox within the wood,</p>
<p>His teeth and claws are red with blood.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Within his leafy, dark retreat</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, trenchant his avenging sword!</p>

<p>The Saxons of this lay are, of course, the Norsemen,
who, speaking a Teutonic tongue, would seem to the
Celtic-speaking Bretons to be allied to the Teuton
Franks.</p>
<h3><i>Bretons and Normans</i></h3>
<p>During the latter half of the tenth and most of the
eleventh century the Counts of Rennes gained an
almost complete ascendancy in Brittany, which began
to be broken up into counties and seigneuries in the
French manner. In 992 Geoffrey, son of Conan, Count
of Rennes, adopted the title of Duke of Brittany. He
married a Norman lady of noble family, by whom he
had two sons, Alain and Eudo, the younger of whom
demanded a share of the duchy as his inheritance. His
brother made over to him the counties of PenthiÃ¨vre
and TrÃ©guier, part of the old kingdom of Domnonia in
the north. It was a fatal transference, for he and his
line became remorseless enemies of the ducal house,
with whom they carried on a series of disastrous conflicts
for centuries. Conan II, son of Alain, came
under the regency of Eudo, his uncle, in infancy, but
later turned his sword against him and his abettor,
William of Normandy, the Conqueror.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>Notwithstanding the national enmity of the Normans
and Bretons, there existed between the Dukes of
Normandy and the Dukes of Brittany ties of affinity
that rendered the relations between the two states
somewhat complicated. At the time when Duke
Robert, the father of William of Normandy, set out
upon his pilgrimage, he had no nearer relative than
Alain, Duke of Brittany, the father of Conan II,
descended in the female line from Rollo, the great
Norse leader, and to him he committed on his departure
the care of his duchy and the guardianship of his son.</p>
<p>Duke Alain declared the paternity of his ward doubtful,
and favoured that party which desired to set him aside
from the succession; but after the defeat of his faction
at Val-Ã¨s-Dunes he died, apparently of poison, doubtless
administered by the contrivance of the friends of
William. His son, Conan II, succeeded, and reigned
at the period when William was making his preparations
for the conquest of England. He was a prince of ability,
dreaded by his neighbours, and animated by a fierce
desire to injure the Duke of Normandy, whom he
regarded as a usurper and the murderer of his father
Alain. Seeing William engaged in a hazardous enterprise,
Conan thought it a favourable moment to declare
war against him, and dispatched one of his chamberlains
to him with the following message: &ldquo;I hear that you
are ready to pass the sea to make conquest of the
kingdom of England. Now, Duke Robert, whose son
you feign to consider yourself, on his departure for
Jerusalem left all his inheritance to Duke Alain, my
father, who was his cousin; but you and your abettors
have poisoned my father, you have appropriated to
yourself the domain of Normandy, and have kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
possession of it until this day, contrary to all right,
since you are not the legitimate heir. Restore to me,
therefore, the duchy of Normandy, which belongs to
me, or I shall levy war upon you, and shall wage it to
extremity with all my forces.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>The Poisoned Hunting-Horn</i></h3>
<p>The Norman historians state that William was much
startled by so hostile a message; for even a feeble
diversion might render futile his ambitious hopes of
conquest. But without hesitation he resolved to
remove the Breton Duke. Immediately upon his return
to Conan, the envoy, gained over, doubtless, by a bribe
of gold, rubbed poison into the inside of the horn which
his master sounded when hunting, and, to make his evil
measures doubly sure, he poisoned in like manner the
Duke&rsquo;s gloves and his horse&rsquo;s bridle. Conan died a few
days after his envoy&rsquo;s return, and his successor, Eudo,
took especial care not to imitate his relative in giving
offence to William with regard to the validity of his right;
on the contrary, he formed an alliance with him, a thing
unheard of betwixt Breton and Norman, and sent his
two sons to William&rsquo;s camp to serve against the English.</p>
<p>These two youths, Brian and Alain, repaired to the
rendezvous of the Norman forces, accompanied by a
body of Breton knights, who styled them Mac-tierns.<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
Certain other wealthy Bretons, who were not of the
pure Celtic race, and who bore French names, as Robert
de Vitry, Bertrand de Dinan, and Raoul de Gael, resorted
likewise to the Court of the Duke of Normandy
with offers of service.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>Later Brittany became a bone of contention between
France and Normandy. Hoel, the native Duke, claimed
the protection of France against the Norman duchy.
A long period of peace followed under Alain Fergant
and Conan III, but on the death of the latter a fierce
war of succession was waged (1148-56). Conan IV
secured the ducal crown by Norman-English aid, and
gave his daughter Constance in marriage to Geoffrey
Plantagenet, son of Henry II of England. Geoffrey
was crowned Duke of Brittany in 1171, but after his
death his son Arthur met with a dreadful fate at the
hands of his uncle, John of England. Constance, his
mother, the real heiress to the duchy, married again,
her choice falling upon Guy de Thouars, and their
daughter was wed to Pierre de Dreux, who became
Duke, and who defeated John Lackland, the slayer of his
wife&rsquo;s half-brother, under the walls of Nantes in 1214.</p>
<h3><i>French Influence</i></h3>
<p>The country now began to flourish apace because of
the many innovations introduced into it by the wisdom
of its French rulers. A new way of life was adopted
by the governing classes, among whom French manners
and fashions became the rule. But the people at large
retained their ancient customs, language, and dress;
nor have they ever abandoned them, at least in Lower
Brittany. On the death of John III (1341) the peace of
the duchy was once more broken by a war of succession.
John had no love for his half-brother, John of Montfort,
and bequeathed the ducal coronet to his niece, Joan
of PenthiÃ¨vre, wife of Charles of Blois, nephew of Philip
VI of France. This precipitated a conflict between the
rival parties which led to years of bitter strife.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<h3><i>The War of the Two Joans</i></h3>
<p>Just as two women, Fredegonda and Brunhilda, swayed
the fortunes of Neustria and Austrasia in Merovingian
times, and Mary and Elizabeth those of England and
Scotland at a later day, so did two heroines arise to
uphold the banners of either party in the civil strife
which now convulsed the Breton land. England took
the side of Montfort and the French that of Charles.
Almost at the outset (1342) John of Montfort was
taken prisoner, but his heroic wife, Joan of Flanders,
grasped the leadership of affairs, and carried on a
relentless war against her husband&rsquo;s enemies. After
five years of fighting, in 1347, and two years subsequent
to the death of her lord, whose health had given way
after his imprisonment, she captured her arch-foe,
Charles of Blois himself, at the battle of La Roche-Derrien,
on the Jaudy. In this encounter she had the
assistance of a certain Sir Thomas Dagworth and an
English force. Three times was Charles rescued, and
thrice was he retaken, until, bleeding from eighteen
wounds, he was compelled to surrender. He was sent
to London, where he was confined in the Tower for nine
years. Meanwhile his wife, Joan, imitating her rival
and namesake, in turn threw her energies into the
strife. But another victory for the Montfort party was
gained at Mauron in 1352. On the release of Charles
of Blois in 1356 he renewed hostilities with the help
of the famous Bertrand Du Guesclin.</p>
<h3><i>Bertrand Du Guesclin</i></h3>
<p>Bertrand Du Guesclin (<i>c.</i> 1320-80), Constable of France,
divides with Bayard the Fearless the crown of medieval
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
French chivalry as a mighty leader of men, a great
soldier, and a blameless knight. He was born of an
ancient family who were in somewhat straitened
circumstances, and in childhood was an object of
aversion to his parents because of his ugliness.</p>
<p>One night his mother dreamt that she was in possession
of a casket containing portraits of herself and her
lord, on one side of which were set nine precious stones
of great beauty encircling a rough, unpolished pebble.
In her dream she carried the casket to a lapidary,
and asked him to take out the rough stone as unworthy
of such goodly company; but he advised her to
allow it to remain, and afterward it shone forth more
brilliantly than the lustrous gems. The later superiority
of Bertrand over her nine other children fulfilled the
mother&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>At the tournament which was held at Rennes in 1338
to celebrate the marriage of Charles of Blois with
Joan of PenthiÃ¨vre, young Bertrand, at that time only
some eighteen years old, unhorsed the most famous
competitors. During the war between Blois and
Montfort he gathered round him a band of adventurers
and fought on the side of Charles V, doing much despite
to the forces of Montfort and his ally of England.</p>
<p>Du Guesclin&rsquo;s name lives in Breton legend as Gwezklen,
perhaps the original form, and approximating to that
on his tomb at Saint-Denis, where he lies at the feet
of Charles V of France. In this inscription it is spelt
&ldquo;Missire Bertram du Gueaquien,&rdquo; perhaps a French
rendering of the Breton pronunciation. Not a few
legendary ballads which recount the exploits of this
manly and romantic figure remain in the Breton
language, and I have made a free translation of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
following, as it is perhaps the most interesting of the
number:</p>
<h4>THE WARD OF DU GUESCLIN</h4>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Trogoff&rsquo;s strong tower in English hands</p>

<p>Rising above its subject-lands</p>
<p>And held in hate and fear.</p>
<p>That rosy gleam upon the sward</p>
<p>Is not the sun&rsquo;s last kiss;</p>
<p>It is the blood of an English lord</p>
<p>Who ruled the land amiss.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;O sweetest daughter of my heart,</p>
<p>My little Marguerite,</p>
<p>Come, carry me the midday milk</p>

<p>From every country lass.&rdquo;</p>

</div></div>
<p>In the decisive battle of Auray (1364) Charles was
killed and Du Guesclin taken prisoner. John of
Montfort, son of the John who had died, became Duke
of Brittany. But he had to face Oliver de Clisson,
round whom the adherents of Blois rallied. From a
war the strife degenerated into a vendetta. Oliver
de Clisson seized the person of John V and imprisoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
him. But in the end John was liberated and the line of
Blois was finally crushed.</p>
<h3><i>Anne of Brittany</i></h3>
<p>The next event of importance in Breton history is the
enforced marriage of Anne of Brittany, Duchess of that
country in her own right, to Charles VIII of France,
son of Louis XI, which event took place in 1491.
Anne, whose father, Duke Francis II, had but recently
died, had no option but to espouse Charles, and on his
death she married Louis XII, his successor. Francis I,
who succeeded Louis XII on the throne of France, and
who married Claude, daughter of Louis XII and Anne,
annexed the duchy in 1532, providing for its privileges.
But beneath the cramping hand of French power the
privileges of the province were greatly reduced. From
this time the history of Brittany is merged in that of
France, of which country it becomes one of the component
parts in a political if not a racial sense.</p>
<p>We shall not in this place deal with the people of
modern Brittany, their manners and customs, reserving
the subject for a later chapter, but shall ask the reader
to accompany us while we traverse the enchanted ground
of Breton story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II: MENHIRS AND DOLMENS</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">In</span> the mind of the general reader Brittany is unalterably
associated with the prehistoric stone
monuments which are so closely identified with
its folk-lore and national life. In other parts of the
world similar monuments are encountered, in Great
Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, the Crimea, Algeria, and
India, but nowhere are they found in such abundance as
in Brittany, nor are these rivalled in other lands, either
as regards their character or the space they occupy.</p>
<p>To speculate as to the race which built the primitive
stone monuments of Brittany is almost as futile as it
would be to theorize upon the date of their erection.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
A generation ago it was usual to refer all European
megalithic monuments to a &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo; origin, but European
ethnological problems have become too complicated of
late years to permit such a theory to pass unchallenged,
especially now that the term &lsquo;Celt&rsquo; is itself matter for
fierce controversy. In the immediate neighbourhood
of certain of these monuments objects of the Iron Age
are recovered from the soil, while near others the finds
are of Bronze Age character, so that it is probably
correct to surmise that their construction continued
throughout a prolonged period.</p>
<h3><i>What Menhirs and Dolmens are</i></h3>
<p>Regarding the nomenclature of the several species of
megalithic monuments met with in Brittany some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
definitions are necessary. A menhir is a rude monolith
set up on end, a great single stone, the base of which
is buried deep in the soil. A dolmen is a large, table-shaped
stone, supported by three, four, or even five
other stones, the bases of which are sunk in the earth.
In Britain the term &lsquo;cromlech&rsquo; is synonymous with that
of &lsquo;dolmen,&rsquo; but in France and on the Continent generally
it is exclusively applied to that class of monument
for which British scientists have no other name than
&lsquo;stone circles.&rsquo; The derivation of the words from
Celtic and their precise meaning in that tongue may
assist the reader to arrive at their exact significance.
Thus &lsquo;menhir&rsquo; seems to be derived from the Welsh
or Brythonic <i>maen</i>, &lsquo;a stone,&rsquo; and <i>hir</i>, &lsquo;long,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;dolmen&rsquo; from Breton <i>taol</i>, &lsquo;table,&rsquo; and <i>men</i>, &lsquo;a stone.&rsquo;<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
&lsquo;Cromlech&rsquo; is also of Welsh or Brythonic origin, and
is derived from <i>crom</i>, &lsquo;bending&rsquo; or &lsquo;bowed&rsquo; (hence
&lsquo;laid across&rsquo;), and <i>llech</i>, &lsquo;a flat stone.&rsquo; The <i>allÃ©e
couverte</i> is a dolmen on a large scale.</p>
<h3><i>The Nature of the Monuments</i></h3>
<p>The nature of these monuments and the purpose for
which they were erected were questions which powerfully
exercised the minds of the antiquaries of a century
ago, who fiercely contended for their use as altars, open-air
temples, and places of rendezvous for the discussion
of tribal affairs. The cooler arch&aelig;ologists of a later
day have discarded the majority of such theories as
untenable in the light of hard facts. The dolmens,
they say, are highly unsuitable for the purpose of altars,
and as it has been proved that this class of monument
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
was invariably covered in prehistoric times by an
earthen tumulus its ritualistic use is thereby rendered
improbable. Moreover, if we chance upon any rude
carving or incised work on dolmens we observe that it
is invariably executed on the <i>lower</i> surface of the table
stone, the upper surface being nearly always rough,
unhewn, often naturally rounded, and as unlike the
surface of an altar as possible.</p>
<p>Recent research has established the much more reasonable
theory that these monuments are sepulchral in
character, and that they mark the last resting-places of
persons of tribal importance, chiefs, priests, or celebrated
warriors. Occasionally legend assists us to prove the
mortuary character of menhir and dolmen. But, without
insisting any further for the present upon the
purpose of these monuments, let us glance at the more
widely known of Brittany&rsquo;s prehistoric structures, not
so much in the manner of the arch&aelig;ologist as in that
of the observant traveller who is satisfied to view them
as interesting relics of human handiwork bequeathed
from a darker age, rather than as objects to satisfy the
arch&aelig;ological taste for discussion.</p>
<p>For this purpose we shall select the best known groups
of Breton prehistoric structures, and shall begin our
excursion at the north-eastern extremity of Brittany,
following the coast-line, on which most of the principal
prehistoric centres are situated, and, as occasion offers,
journeying into the interior in search of famous or
interesting examples.</p>
<h3><i>Dol</i></h3>
<p>Dol is situated in the north of the department of Ille-et-Vilaine,
not far from the sea-coast. Near it, in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
field called the Champ Dolent (&lsquo;Field of Woe&rsquo;), stands
a gigantic menhir, about thirty feet high and said to
measure fifteen more underground. It is composed of
grey granite, and is surmounted by a cross. The early
Christian missionaries, finding it impossible to wean the
people from frequenting pagan neighbourhoods, surmounted
the standing stones with the symbol of their
faith, and this in time brought about the result desired.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<h3><i>The Legend of Dol</i></h3>
<p>A strange legend is connected with this rude menhir.
On a day in the dark, uncharted past of Brittany a
fierce battle was fought in the Champ Dolent. Blood
ran in streams, sufficient, says the tale, to turn a mill-wheel
in the neighbourhood of the battlefield. When
the combat was at its height two brothers met and
grappled in fratricidal strife. But ere they could harm
one another the great granite shaft which now looms
above the field rose up between them and separated
them.</p>
<p>There appears to be some historical basis for the tale.
Here, or in the neighbourhood, <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 560, met Clotaire,
King of the Franks, and his son, the rebel Chramne.
The rebellious son was signally defeated. He had
placed his wife and two little daughters in a dwelling
hard by, and as he made his way thence to convey
them from the field he was captured. He was instantly
strangled, by order of his brutal father, in the sight
of his wife and little ones, who were then burned alive
in the house where they had taken refuge. The Champ
Dolent does not belie its name, and even thirteen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
centuries and a half have failed to obliterate the memory
of a savage and unnatural crime, which, its remoteness
notwithstanding, fills the soul with loathing against its
perpetrators and with deep pity for the hapless and
innocent victims.</p>
<h3><i>A Subterranean Dolmen Chapel</i></h3>
<p>At Plouaret, in the department of CÃ´tes-du-Nord, is
a curious subterranean chapel incorporating a dolmen.
The dolmen was formerly partially embedded in a
tumulus, and the chapel, erected in 1702, was so constructed
that the great table-stone of the dolmen has
become the chapel roof, and the supporting stones form
two of its sides. The crypt is reached by a flight of
steps, and here may be seen an altar to the Seven
Sleepers, represented by seven dolls of varying size.
The Bretons have a legend that this structure dates from
the creation of the world, and they have embodied this
belief in a ballad, in which it is piously affirmed that
the shrine was built by the hand of the Almighty at
the time when the world was in process of formation.</p>
<h3><i>Camaret</i></h3>
<p>Camaret, on the coast of FinistÃ¨re, is the site of no
less than forty-one standing stones of quartz, which
outline a rectangular space 600 yards in length at its
base. Many stones have been removed, so that the
remaining sides are incomplete. None of these monoliths
is of any considerable size, however, and the site
is not considered to be of much importance, save as
regards its isolated character. At Penmarch, in the
southern extremity of FinistÃ¨re, there is an &lsquo;alignment&rsquo;
of some two hundred small stones, and a dolmen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
of some importance is situated at TrÃ©gunc, but it is
at Carnac, on the coast of Morbihan, that we arrive at
the most important arch&aelig;ological district in Brittany.</p>
<h3><i>Carnac</i></h3>
<p>The Carnac district teems with prehistoric monuments,
the most celebrated of which are those of Plouharnel,
Concarneau, Concurrus, Locmariaquer, Kermario, Kerlescant,
Erdeven, and Sainte-Barbe. All these places
are situated within a few miles of one another, and
a good centre from which excursions can be made to
each is the little town of Auray, with its quaint
medieval market-house and shrine of St Roch. Arch&aelig;ologists,
both Breton and foreign, appear to be agreed
that the groups of stones at MÃ©nÃ©ac, Kermario, and
Kerlescant are portions of one original and continuous
series of alignments which extended for nearly two
miles in one direction from south-west to north-east.
The monolithic avenue commences quite near the
village of MÃ©nÃ©ac, stretching away in eleven rows, and
here the large stones are situated, these at first rising
to a height of from 10 to 13 feet, and becoming
gradually smaller, until they attain only 3 or 4 feet.
In all there are 116 menhirs at MÃ©nÃ©ac. For more than
three hundred yards there is a gap in the series, which
passed, we come to the Kermario avenue, which consists
of ten rows of monoliths of much the same size
as those of MÃ©nÃ©ac, and 1120 in number.</p>
<p>Passing on to Kerlescant, with its thirteen rows of
menhirs made up of 570 individual stones, we come
to the end of the avenue and gaze backward upon
the plain covered with these indestructible symbols of
a forgotten past.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>Carnac! There is something vast, Egyptian, in the
name! There is, indeed, a Karnak in Egypt, celebrated
for its Avenue of Sphinxes and its pillared temple
raised to the goddess Mut by King Amenophis III.
Here, in the Breton Carnac, are no evidences of
architectural skill. These sombre stones, unworked,
rude as they came from cliff or seashore, are not
embellished by man&rsquo;s handiwork like the rich temples
of the Nile. But there is about this stone-littered moor
a mystery, an atmosphere no less intense than that
surrounding the most solemn ruins of antiquity. Deeper
even than the depths of Egypt must we sound if we are
to discover the secret of Carnac. What mean these
stones? What means faith? What signifies belief?
What is the answer to the Riddle of Man? In the
words of Cayot DÃ©landre, a Breton poet:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Tout cela eut un sens, et traduisit</p>
<p>Une pensÃ©e; mais clÃ© de ce mystÃ¨re,</p>
<p>OÃ¹ est elle? et qui pourrait dire aujourd&rsquo;hui</p>
<p>Si jamais elle se retrouvera?<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a></p>
</div></div>
<h3><i>A Vision</i></h3>
<p>Over this wild, heathy track, covered with the blue
flowers of the dwarf gentian, steals a subtle change.
Nor air nor heath has altered. The lichen-covered
grey stones are the same. Suddenly there arises the
burden of a low, fierce chant. A swarm of skin-clad
figures appears, clustering around a gigantic object
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
which they are painfully dragging toward a deep pit
situated at the end of one of the enormous alleys of
monoliths. On rudely shaped rollers rests a huge stone
some twenty feet in length, and this they drag across
the rough moor by ropes of hide, lightening their
labours by the chant, which relates the exploits of the
warrior-chief who has lately been entombed in this
vast pantheon of Carnac. The menhir shall serve for
his headstone. It has been vowed to him by the
warriors of his tribe, his henchmen, who have fought
and hunted beside him, and who revere his memory.
This stone shall render his fame immortal.</p>
<p>And now the task of placing the huge monolith in
position begins. Ropes are attached to one extremity,
and while a line of brawny savages strains to raise this,
others guide that end of the monolith destined for
enclosure in the earth toward the pit which has been
dug for its reception. Higher and higher rises the
stone, until at last it sinks slowly into its earthy bed.
It is held in an upright position while the soil is packed
around it and it is made secure. Then the barbarians
stand back a space and gaze at it from beneath their
low brows, well pleased with their handiwork. He
whom they honoured in life rests not unrecognized in
death.</p>

RAISING A MENHIR<br />

<h3><i>The Legend of Carnac</i></h3>
<p>The legend of Carnac which explains these avenues of
monoliths bears a resemblance to the Cornish story of
&lsquo;the Hurlers,&rsquo; who were turned into stone for playing
at hurling on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, or to that other English
example from Cumberland of &lsquo;Long Meg&rsquo; and her
daughters. St Cornely, we are told, pursued by an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
army of pagans, fled toward the sea. Finding no boat
at hand, and on the point of being taken, he transformed
his pursuers into stones, the present monoliths.</p>
<p>The Saint had made his flight to the coast in a bullock-cart,
and perhaps for this reason he is now regarded as
the patron of cattle. Should a bullock fall sick, his
owner purchases an image of St Cornely and hangs it
up in the stable until the animal recovers. The church
at Carnac contains a series of fresco paintings which
outline events in the life of the Saint, and in the churchyard
there is a representation of the holy man between
two bullocks. The head of St Cornely is said to be
preserved within the edifice as a relic. On the 13th of
September is held at Carnac the festival of the &lsquo;Benediction
of the Beasts,&rsquo; which is celebrated in honour of
St Cornely. The cattle of the district are brought to the
vicinity of the church and blessed by the priests&mdash;should
sufficient monetary encouragement be forthcoming.</p>
<h3><i>Mont-Saint-Michel</i></h3>
<p>In the neighbourhood is Mont-Saint-Michel,<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> a great
tumulus with a sepulchral dolmen, first excavated in
1862, when late Stone Age implements, jade celts, and
burnt bones were unearthed. Later M. Zacharie Le
Rouzic, the well-known Breton arch&aelig;ologist, tunnelled
into the tumulus, and discovered a mortuary chamber,
in which were the incinerated remains of two oxen.
To this tumulus each pilgrim added a stone or small
quantity of earth, as has been the custom in Celtic
countries from time immemorial, and so the funerary
mound in the course of countless generations grew into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
quite a respectable hill, on which a chapel was built,
dedicated to St Michael, from the doorway of which
a splendid prospect of the great stone alignments can
be had, with, for background, the Morbihan and the
long, dreary peninsula of Quiberon, bleak, treeless, and
deserted.</p>
<h3><i>Rocenaud</i></h3>
<p>Near Carnac is the great dolmen of Rocenaud, the
&lsquo;cup-and-ring&rsquo; markings on which are thought by the
surrounding peasantry to have been made by the knees
and elbows of St Roch, who fell upon this stone when
he landed from Ireland. When the natives desire a
wind they knock upon the depressions with their
knuckles, murmuring spells the while, just as in Scotland
in the seventeenth century a tempest was raised by
dipping a rag in water and beating it on a stone thrice
in the name of Satan.</p>
<h3><i>Cup-and-Ring Markings</i></h3>
<p>What do these cup-and-ring markings so commonly discovered
upon the monuments of Brittany portend? The
question is one well worth examining at some length,
as it appears to be almost at the foundations of Neolithic
religion. Recent discoveries in New Caledonia have
proved the existence in these far-off islands, as in
Brittany, Scotland, and Ireland, of these strange
symbols, coupled with the concentric and spiral designs
which are usually associated with the genius of Celtic
art. In the neighbourhood of Glasgow, and in the
south-west of Scotland generally, stones inscribed with
designs closely resembling those on the New Caledonian
rocks have been found in abundance, as at Auchentorlie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
and Cockno, Shewalton Sands, and in the Milton of
Colquhoun district, where the famous &lsquo;cup-and-ring
altar&rsquo; was discovered. At Shewalton Sands in particular,
in 1904, a number of stones were found bearing
crosses like those discovered in Portugal by Father
JosÃ© Brenha and Father Rodriguez. These symbols
have a strong resemblance to certain markings on the
Breton rocks, and are thought to possess an alphabetic
or magical significance. In Scotland spirals are commonly
found on stones marked with ogham inscriptions,
and it is remarkable that they should occur in New
Caledonia in connexion with a dot &lsquo;alphabet.&rsquo; The
New Caledonian crosses, however, approximate more to
the later crosses of Celtic art, while the spirals resemble
those met with in the earlier examples of Celtic work.
But the closest parallel to the New Caledonian stone-markings
to be found in Scotland is supplied by the examples
at Cockno, in Dumbartonshire, where the wheel
symbol is associated with the cup-and-ring markings.</p>
<p>The cup-and-ring stones used to be considered the
peculiar product of a race of &lsquo;Brythonic&rsquo; or British
origin, and it is likely that the stones so carved were
utilized in the ritual of rain-worship or rain-making by
sympathetic magic. The grooves in the stone were
probably filled with water to typify a country partially
covered with rain-water.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a></p>
<p>From these analogies, then, we can glean the purpose
of the cup-and-ring markings upon the dolmens of
Brittany, and may conclude, if our considerations are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
well founded, that they were magical in purpose and
origin. Do the cup-shaped depressions represent water,
or are they receptacles for rain, and do the spiral
symbols typify the whirling winds?</p>
<h3><i>The Gallery of Gavr&rsquo;inis</i></h3>
<p>Nowhere are these mysterious markings so well exemplified
as in the wonderful tumulus of Gavr&rsquo;inis.
This ancient place of sepulture, the name of which
means &lsquo;Goat Island,&rsquo; lies in the Morbihan, or &lsquo;Little
Sea,&rsquo; an inland sea which gives its name to a department
in the south of Brittany. The tumulus is 25 feet
high, and covers a fine gallery 40 feet long, the stones of
which bear the markings alluded to. Whorls and circles
abound in the ornamentation, serpent-like figures, and the
representation of an axe, similar to those to be seen in
some of the Grottes aux FÃ©es, or on the Dol des Marchands.
The sculptures appear to have been executed
with metal tools. The passage ends in a square sepulchral
chamber, the supports of which are eight menhirs of
grained granite, a stone not found on the island. Such
of the menhirs as are carved were obviously so treated
before they were placed <i>in situ</i>, as the design passes
round the edges.</p>
<h3><i>The Ile aux Moines</i></h3>
<p>The Ile aux Moines (&lsquo;Monks&rsquo; Island&rsquo;) is also situated
in the Morbihan, and has many prehistoric monuments,
the most extensive of which are the circle of stones at
Kergonan and the dolmen of Penhapp. On the Ile
d&rsquo;Arz, too, are megalithic monuments, perhaps the best
example of which is the cromlech or circle at Penraz.</p>
<p>The folk-beliefs attached to the megalithic monuments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
of Brittany are numerous, but nearly all of them bear a
strong resemblance to each other. Many of the monuments
are called Grottes aux FÃ©es or Roches aux FÃ©es,
in the belief that the fairies either built them or used
them as dwelling-places, and variants of these names
are to be found in the Maison des Follets (&lsquo;House of
the Goblins&rsquo;) at Cancoet, in Morbihan, and the ChÃ¢teau
des Paulpiquets, in Questembert, in the same district.
Ty en Corygannt (&lsquo;The House of the Korrigans&rsquo;)
is situated in the same department, while near Penmarch,
in FinistÃ¨re, at the other end of the province,
we find Ty C&rsquo;harriquet (&lsquo;The House of the Gorics&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Nains&rsquo;). Other mythical personages are also
credited with their erection, most frequently either the
devil or Gargantua being held responsible for their
miraculous creation. The phenomenon, well known to
students of folk-lore, that an unlettered people speedily
forgets the origin of monuments that its predecessors
may have raised in times past is well exemplified in
Brittany, whose peasant-folk are usually surprised, if
not amused, at the question &ldquo;Who built the dolmens?&rdquo;
Close familiarity with and contiguity to uncommon
objects not infrequently dulls the sense of wonder they
should otherwise naturally excite. But lest we feel
tempted to sneer at these poor folk for their incurious
attitude toward the visible antiquities of their land,
let us ask ourselves how many of us take that interest
in the antiquities of our own country or our own
especial locality that they demand.<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<h3><i>Fairy Builders</i></h3>
<p>For the most part, then, the megaliths, in the opinion
of the Breton peasant, are not the handiwork of man.
He would rather refer their origin to spirits, giants, or
fiends. If he makes any exception to this supernatural
attribution, it is in favour of the saints he reverences
so profoundly. The fairies, he says, harnessed their
oxen to the mighty stones, selected a site, and dragged
them thither to form a dwelling, or perhaps a cradle
for the infant fays they were so fond of exchanging
for human children. Thus the Roches aux FÃ©es near
Saint-Didier, in Ille-et-Vilaine, were raised by fairy
hands, the elves collecting &ldquo;all the big stones in the
country&rdquo; and carrying them thither in their aprons.
These architectural sprites then mounted on each
other&rsquo;s shoulders in order that they might reach high
enough to place the mighty monoliths securely in
position. This practice they also followed in building
the dolmen near the wood of Rocher, on the road from
Dinan to Dol, say the people of that country-side.</p>
<p>But the actual purpose of the megaliths has not been
neglected by tradition, for a venerable farmer at Rouvray
stated that the fairies were wont to honour after
their death those who had made good use of their lives
and built the dolmens to contain their ashes. The
presence of such a shrine in a country-side was a
guarantee of abundance and prosperity therein, as a
subtle and indefinable charm spread from the saintly
remnants and communicated itself to everything in
the neighbourhood.<a name='FNanchor_0013' id='FNanchor_0013'></a><a href='#Footnote_0013' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> The fairy builders, says tradition,
went about their work in no haphazard manner. Those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
among them who possessed a talent for design drew
the plans of the proposed structure, the less gifted
acting as carriers, labourers, and masons. Apron-carrying
was not their only method of porterage, for
some bore the stones on their heads, or one under
each arm, as when they raised the Roche aux FÃ©es
in Retiers, or the dolmen in La Lande Marie.<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> The
space of a night was usually sufficient in which to raise
a dolmen. But though &lsquo;run up&rsquo; with more than Transatlantic
dispatch, in view of the time these structures
have endured for, any charge of jerry-building against
their elfin architects must fall to the ground. Daylight,
too, frequently surprised the fairy builders, so that they
could not finish their task, as many a &lsquo;roofless&rsquo; dolmen
shows.</p>
<p>There are many Celtic parallels to this belief. For
example, it is said that the Picts, or perhaps the
fairies, built the original church of Corstorphine, near
Edinburgh, and stood in a row handing the stones
on, one to another, from Ravelston Quarry, on the
adjacent hill of Corstorphine. Such is the local folk-tale;
and it has its congeners in Celtic and even in
Hindu myth. Thus in the Highland tale of Kennedy
and the <i>claistig</i>, or fairy, whom he captured, and
whom he compelled to build him a house in one night,
we read that she set her people to work speedily:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>And they brought flags and stones</p>
<p>From the shores of Cliamig waterfall,</p>
<p>Reaching them from hand to hand.<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a></p>
</div></div>
<p>Again, the Round Tower of Ardmore, in Ireland, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
built with stones brought from Slieve Grian, a mountain
some four or five miles distant, &ldquo;without horse or
wheel,&rdquo; the blocks being passed from hand to hand
from the quarry to the site of the building. The same
tradition applied to the Round Tower of Abernethy,
in Perthshire, only it is in this case demonstrated that
the stone of which the tower is composed was actually
taken from the traditional quarry, even the very spot
being geologically identified.<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> In like manner, too,
was Rama&rsquo;s bridge built by the monkey host in Hindu
myth, as recounted in the
<i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> and the <i>R&#257;m&#257;yana</i>.</p>
<p>Tales, as apart from beliefs, are not often encountered
in connexion with the monuments. Indeed, SÃ©billot, in
the course of his researches, found only some dozen of
these all told.<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> They are very brief, and appear for the
most part to deal with fairies who have been shut up
by the power of magic in a dolmen. Tales of spirits
enclosed in trees, and even in pillars, are not uncommon,
and lately I have heard a peculiarly fearsome ghost
story which comes from Belgium, in which it is related
how certain spirits had become enclosed in a pillar in
an ancient abbey, for the saintly occupants of which
they made it particularly uncomfortable. Mr George
Henderson, in one of the most masterly and suggestive
studies of Celtic survivals ever published, states that
stones in the Highlands of Scotland were formerly
believed to have souls, and that those too large to be
moved &ldquo;were held to be in intimate connexion with
spirits.&rdquo; Pillared stones are not employed in building
dwellings in the Highlands, ill luck, it is believed, being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
sure to follow their use in this manner, while to
&lsquo;meddle&rsquo; with stones which tradition connects with
Druidism is to court fatality.<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a></p>
<h3><i>Stones that Travel</i></h3>
<p>M. Salomon Reinach tells us of the Breton belief that
certain sacred stones go once a year or once a century
to &lsquo;wash&rsquo; themselves in the sea or in a river, returning
to their ancient seats after their ablutions.<a name='FNanchor_0019' id='FNanchor_0019'></a><a href='#Footnote_0019' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> The stones
in the dolmen of EssÃ© are thought to change their places
continually, like those of Callernish and Lewis, and,
like the Roman Penates, to have the gift of coming and
going if removed from their habitual site.</p>
<p>The megalithic monuments of Brittany are undoubtedly
the most remarkable relics of that epoch of prehistoric
activity which is now regarded as the immediate forerunner
of civilization. Can it be that they were
miraculously preserved by isolation from the remote
beginnings of that epoch, or is it more probable that
they were constructed at a relatively late period? These
are questions of profound difficulty, and it is likely that
both theories contain a certain amount of truth.
Whatever may have been the origin of her megaliths,
Brittany must ever be regarded as a great prehistoric
museum, a unique link with a past of hoary antiquity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III: THE FAIRIES OF BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Whatever</span> the origin of the race which
conceived the demonology of Brittany&mdash;and
there are indications that it was not
wholly Celtic&mdash;that weird province of FaÃ«ry bears
unmistakable evidence of having been deeply impressed
by the Celtic imagination, if it was not totally peopled
by it, for its various inhabitants act in the Celtic spirit,
are moved by Celtic springs of thought and fancy, and
possess not a little of that irritability which has forced
anthropologists to include the Celtic race among those
peoples described as &lsquo;sanguine-bilious.&rsquo; As a rule they
are by no means friendly or even humane, these fays
of Brittany, and if we find beneficent elves within the
green forests of the duchy we may feel certain that they
are French immigrants, and therefore more polished
than the choleric native sprites.</p>
<h3><i>Broceliande</i></h3>
<p>Of all the many localities celebrated in the fairy
lore of Brittany none is so famous as Broceliande.
Broceliande! &ldquo;The sound is like a bell,&rdquo; a far, faÃ«ry
chime in a twilit forest. In the name Broceliande
there seems to be gathered all the tender charm, the
rich and haunting mystery, the remote magic of
Brittany and Breton lore. It is, indeed, the title to
the rarest book in the library of poetic and traditional
romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to seek out marvels,&rdquo; said old Wace. &ldquo;The
forest I saw, the land I saw. I sought marvels, but I
found none. A fool I came back, a fool I went; a fool
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
I went, a fool I came back; foolishness I sought; a fool
I hold myself.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a></p>
<p>Our age, even less sceptical than his, sees no folly in
questing for the beautiful, and if we expect no marvels,
nor any sleight of faÃ«ry, however desirous we are, we
do not hold it time lost to plunge into the enchanted
forest and in its magic half-gloom grope for, and
perchance grasp, dryad draperies, or be trapped in the
filmy webs of fancy which are spun in these shadows for
unwary mortals.</p>
<p>Standing in dream-girt Broceliande of a hundred
legends, its shadows mirrored by dim meres that may
never reflect the stars, one feels the lure of Brittany
more keenly even than when walking by its fierce and
jagged coasts menaced by savage grey seas, or when
wandering on its vast moors where the monuments
of its pagan past stand in gigantic disarray. For in
the forest is the heart of Arthurian story, the shrine
of that wonder which has drawn thousands to this land
of legend, who, like old Wace, trusted to have found, if
not elfin marvels, at least matter of phantasy conjured
up by the legendary associations of Broceliande.</p>
<p>But we must beware of each step in these twilit
recesses, for the fays of Brittany are not as those of
other lands. Harsh things are spoken of them. They
are malignant, say the forest folk. The note of Brittany
is scarce a joyous one. It is bitter-sweet as a sad chord
struck on an ancient harp.</p>
<p>The fays of Brittany are not the friends of man. They
are not &lsquo;the good people,&rsquo; &lsquo;the wee folk&rsquo;; they have no
endearing names, the gift of a grateful peasantry. Cold
and hostile, they hold aloof from human converse, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
should they encounter man, vent their displeasure at the
interruption in the most vindictive manner.</p>
<p>Whether the fairies of Brittany be the late representatives
of the gods of an elder day or merely
animistic spirits who have haunted these glades since
man first sheltered in them, certain it is that in no other
region in Europe has Mother Church laid such a heavy
ban upon all the things of faÃ«ry as in this strange and
isolated peninsula. A more tolerant ecclesiastical rule
might have weaned them to a timid friendship, but
all overtures have been discouraged, and to-day they
are enemies, active, malignant, swift to inflict evil upon
the pious peasant because he is pious and on the
energetic because of his industry.</p>
<h3><i>The Korrigan</i></h3>
<p>Among those forest-beings of whom legend speaks such
malice none is more relentless than the Korrigan, who
has power to enmesh the heart of the most constant
swain and doom him to perish miserably for love of her.
Beware of the fountains and of the wells of this forest
of Broceliande, for there she is most commonly to be encountered,
and you may know her by her bright hair&mdash;&ldquo;like
golden wire,&rdquo; as Spenser says of his lady&rsquo;s&mdash;her red,
flashing eyes, and her laughing lips. But if you would
dare her wiles you must come alone to her fountain by
night, for she shuns even the half-gloom that is day in
shadowy Broceliande. The peasants when they speak
of her will assure you that she and her kind are pagan
princesses of Brittany who would have none of Christianity
when the holy Apostles brought it to Armorica,
and who must dwell here under a ban, outcast and
abhorred.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<h3><i>The Seigneur of Nann</i><a name='FNanchor_0021' id='FNanchor_0021'></a><a href='#Footnote_0021' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a></h3>
<p>The Seigneur of Nann was high of heart, for that day
his bride of a year had presented him with two beautiful
children, a boy and a girl, both white as May-blossom.
In his joy the happy father asked his wife her heart&rsquo;s
desire, and she, pining for that which idle fancy urged
upon her, begged him to bring her a dish of woodcock
from the lake in the dale, or of venison from the
greenwood. The Seigneur of Nann seized his lance
and, vaulting on his jet-black steed, sought the borders
of the forest, where he halted to survey the ground
for track of roe or slot of the red deer. Of a sudden
a white doe rose in front of him, and was lost in the
forest like a silver shadow.</p>
<p>At sight of this fair quarry the Seigneur followed into
the greenwood. Ever his prey rustled among the
leaves ahead, and in the hot chase he recked not of the
forest depths into which he had plunged. But coming
upon a narrow glade where the interlacing leaves above
let in the sun to dapple the moss-ways below, he saw
a strange lady sitting by the broken border of a well,
braiding her fair hair and binding it with golden pins.</p>
<p>The Seigneur louted low, begged that he might
drink, and bending down set his lips to the water;
but she, turning strange eyes upon him&mdash;eyes not
blue like those of his bride, nor grey, nor brown, nor
black, like those of other women, but red in their
depths as the heart&rsquo;s blood of a dove&mdash;spoke to him
discourteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you who dare to trouble the waters of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
fountain?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do you not know that your
conduct merits death? This well is enchanted, and by
drinking of it you are fated to die, unless you fulfil a
certain condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked the Seigneur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must marry me within the hour,&rdquo; replied the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demoiselle,&rdquo; replied the Seigneur, &ldquo;it may not be
as you desire, for I am already espoused to a
fair bride who has borne me this very day a son
and a daughter. Nor shall I die until it pleases the
good God. Nevertheless, I wot well who you are.
Rather would I die on the instant than wed with a
Korrigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping upon his horse, he turned and rode from the
woodland as a man possessed. As he drew homeward
he was overshadowed by a sense of coming ill. At the
gate of his chÃ¢teau stood his mother, anxious to greet
him with good news of his bride. But with averted
eyes he addresses her in the refrain so familiar to the
folk-poetry of all lands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My good mother, if you love me, make my bed. I am sick
unto death. Say not a word to my bride. For within three
days I shall be laid in the grave. A Korrigan has done
me evil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three days later the young spouse asks of her mother-in-law:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, mother, why do the bells sound? Wherefore
do the priests chant so low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing, daughter,&rdquo; replies the elder woman. &ldquo;A
poor stranger who lodged here died this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, where is gone the Seigneur of Nann? Mother,
oh, where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone to the town, my child. In a little he
will come to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, mother, let us speak of happy things. Must I
wear my red or my blue robe at my churching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, daughter. The mode is changed. You
must wear black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unconscious in its art, the stream of verse carries us
to the church, whence the young wife has gone to
offer up thanks for the gift of children. She sees
that the ancestral tomb has been opened, and a great
dread is at her heart. She asks her mother-in-law
who has died, and the old woman at last confesses
that the Seigneur of Nann has just been buried.</p>
<p>That same night the young mother was interred beside
her husband-lover. And the peasant folk say that from
that tomb arose two saplings, the branches of which
intertwined more closely as they grew.</p>
<h3><i>A Goddess of Eld</i></h3>
<p>In the depths of Lake Tegid in our own Wales dwelt
Keridwen, a fertility goddess who possessed a magic
cauldron&mdash;the sure symbol of a deity of abundance.<a name='FNanchor_0022' id='FNanchor_0022'></a><a href='#Footnote_0022' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a>
Like Demeter, she was strangely associated with the
harmless necessary sow, badge of many earth-mothers,
and itself typical of fertility. Like Keridwen, the
Korrigan is associated with water, with the element
which makes for vegetable growth. Christian belief
would, of course, transform this discredited goddess into
an evil being whose one function was the destruction
of souls. May we see a relation of the Korrigan and
Keridwen in Tridwan, or St Triduana, of Restalrig,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
near Edinburgh, who presided over a certain well
there, and at whose well-shrine offerings were made
by sightless pilgrims for many centuries?</p>
<p>Many are the traditions which tell of human infants
abducted by the Korrigan, who at times left an ugly
changeling in place of the babe she had stolen. But it
was more as an enchantress that she was dreaded. By
a stroke of her magic wand she could transform the
leafy fastnesses in which she dwelt into the semblance
of a lordly hall, which the luckless traveller whom she
lured thither would regard as a paradise after the dark
thickets in which he had been wandering. This seeming
castle or palace she furnished with everything that could
delight the eye, and as the doomed wretch sat ravished
by her beauty and that of her nine attendant maidens a
fatal passion for her entered his heart, so that whatever
he cherished most on earth&mdash;honour, wife, demoiselle,
or affianced bride&mdash;became as naught to him, and he
cast himself at the feet of this forest Circe in a frenzy
of ardour. But with the first ray of daylight the charm
was dissolved and the Korrigan became a hideous hag,
as repulsive as before she had been lovely; the walls of
her palace and the magnificence which had furnished it
became once more tree and thicket, its carpets moss,
its tapestries leaves, its silver cups wild roses, and its
dazzling mirrors pools of stagnant water.</p>
<h3><i>The Unbroken Vow</i><a name='FNanchor_0023' id='FNanchor_0023'></a><a href='#Footnote_0023' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a></h3>
<p>Sir Roland of Brittany rides through gloomy Broceliande
a league ahead of his troop, unattended by squire or by
page. The red cross upon his shoulder is witness that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
he is vowed to service in Palestine, and as he passes
through the leafy avenues on his way to the rendezvous
he fears that he will be late, most tardy of all the knights
of Brittany who have sworn to drive the paynim from
the Holy Land. Fearful of such disgrace, he spurs his
jaded charger on through the haunted forest, and with
anxious eye watches the sun sink and the gay white
moon sail high above the tree-tops, pouring light
through their branches upon the mossy ways below.</p>
<p>A high vow has Roland taken ere setting out upon the
crusade&mdash;a vow that he will eschew the company of
fair ladies, in which none had delighted more than he.
No more must he mingle in the dance, no more must he
press a maiden&rsquo;s lips with his. He has become a soldier
of the Cross. He may not touch a lady&rsquo;s hand save
with his mailed glove, he must not sit by her side. Also
must he fast from dusk till dawn upon that night of his
setting forth. &ldquo;Small risk,&rdquo; he laughs a little sadly,
as he spurs his charger onward, &ldquo;small risk that I be
mansworn ere morning light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the setting of the moon tells him that he must
rest in the forest until dawn, as without her beams he
can no longer pursue his way. So he dismounts from
his steed, tethers it to a tree, and looks about for a
bed of moss on which to repose. As he does so his
wandering gaze fixes upon a beam of light piercing the
gloom of the forest. Well aware of the traditions of his
country, he thinks at first that it is only the glimmer of
a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp or a light carried by a wandering elf.
But no, on moving nearer the gleam he is surprised to
behold a row of windows brilliantly lit as if for a festival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, by my vow,&rdquo; says Roland, &ldquo;methought I knew
well every chÃ¢teau in this land of Brittany, nor wist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
I that seigneur or count held court in this forest of
Broceliande.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resolved to view the chÃ¢teau at still closer quarters,
he draws near it. A great court fronts him where neither
groom nor porter keeps guard, and within he can see a
fair hall. This he enters, and immediately his ears are
ravished by music which wanders through the chamber
like a sighing zephyr. The murmur of rich viols and
the call of flutes soft as distant bird-song speak to his
very soul. Yet through the ecstasy comes, like a
serpent gliding among flowers, the discord of evil
thoughts. Grasping his rosary, he is about to retire
when the doors at the end of the hall fly open, and he
beholds a rapturous vision. Upon a couch of velvet sits
a lady of such dazzling beauty that all other women
compared with her would seem as kitchen-wenches. A
mantle of rich golden hair falls about her, her eyes shine
with the brightness of stars, her smile seems heavenly.
Round her are grouped nine maidens only less beautiful
than herself.</p>
<p>As the moon moving among attendant stars, so the
lady comes toward Roland, accompanied by her maidens.
She welcomes him, and would remove his gauntlet, but
he tells her of the vow he has made to wear it in lady&rsquo;s
bower, and she is silent. Next she asks him to seat
himself beside her on the couch, but he will not. In
some confusion she orders a repast to be brought. A
table is spread with fragrant viands, but as the knight
will partake of none of them, in chagrin the lady takes
a lute, which she touches with exquisite skill. He listens
unmoved, till, casting away her instrument, she dances
to him, circling round and round about him, flitting
about his chair like a butterfly, until at length she sinks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
down near him and lays her head upon his mailed
bosom. Upward she turns her face to him, all passion-flushed,
her eyes brimming with love. Sir Roland
falters. Fascinated by her unearthly beauty, he is about
to stoop down to press his lips to hers. But as he bends
his head she shrinks from him, for she sees the tender
flush of morning above the eastern tree-tops. The
living stars faint and fail, and the music of awakening
life which accompanies the rising of the young sun falls
upon the ear. Slowly the chÃ¢teau undergoes transformation.
The glittering roof merges into the blue
vault of heaven, the tapestried walls become the ivied
screens of great forest trees, the princely furnishings are
transformed into mossy banks and mounds, and the
rugs and carpets beneath Roland&rsquo;s mailed feet are now
merged in the forest ways.</p>
<p>But the lady? Sir Roland, glancing down, beholds
a hag hideous as sin, whose malicious and distorted
countenance betrays baffled hate and rage. At the
sound of a bugle she hurries away with a discordant
shriek. Into the glade ride Roland&rsquo;s men, to see their
lord clasping his rosary and kneeling in thanksgiving
for his deliverance from the evils which beset him. He
had been saved from breaking his vow!</p>
<p>The nine attendant maidens of the Korrigan bring to
mind a passage in Pomponius Mela<a name='FNanchor_0024' id='FNanchor_0024'></a><a href='#Footnote_0024' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>: &ldquo;Sena [the Ile
de Sein, not far from Brest], in the British Sea, opposite
the Ofismician coast, is remarkable for an oracle of the
Gallic god. Its priestesses, holy in perpetual virginity,
are said to be nine in number. They are called
Gallicen&aelig;, and are thought to be endowed with singular
powers. By their charms they are able to raise the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
winds and seas, to turn themselves into what animals
they will, to cure wounds and diseases incurable by
others, to know and predict the future. But this they
do only for navigators, who go thither purposely to
consult them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like the sylphs and salamanders so humorously
described by the AbbÃ© de Villars in <i>Le Comte de
Gabalis</i>,<a name='FNanchor_0025' id='FNanchor_0025'></a><a href='#Footnote_0025' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> the Korrigans desired union with humanity in
order that they might thus gain immortality. Such, at
least, is the current peasant belief in Brittany. &ldquo;For
this end they violate all the laws of modesty.&rdquo; This
belief is common to all lands, and is typical of the fay,
the Lorelei, countless well and water sprites, and that
enchantress who rode off with Thomas the Rhymer:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>For if you dare to kiss my lips</p>
<p>Sure of your bodie I shall be.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Unlike the colder Sir Roland, &lsquo;True Thomas&rsquo; dared,
and was wafted to a realm wondrously described by
the old balladeer in the vivid phrase that marks the
poetry of vision.</p>
<h3><i>Merlin and Vivien</i></h3>
<p>It was in this same verdant Broceliande that Vivien,
another fairy, that crafty dame of the enchanted lake,
the instructress of Lancelot, bound wise Merlin so that
he might no more go to Camelot with oracular lips to
counsel British Arthur.</p>
<p>But what say the folk of Broceliande themselves of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
this? Let us hear their version of a tale which has
been so battered by modern criticism, and which has
been related in at least half a score of versions, prose
and poetic. Let us have the Broceliande account of
what happened in Broceliande.<a name='FNanchor_0026' id='FNanchor_0026'></a><a href='#Footnote_0026' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> Surely its folk, in the
very forest in which he wandered with Vivien, must
know more of Merlin&rsquo;s enchantment than we of that
greater Britain which he left to find a paradise in Britain
the Less, for, according to Breton story, Merlin was
not imprisoned by magic art, but achieved bliss through
his love for the fairy forest nymph.</p>
<p>Disguised as a young student, Merlin was wandering
one bright May morning through the leafy glades of
Broceliande, when, like the Seigneur of Nann, he came
to a beautiful fountain in the heart of the forest which
tempted him to rest. As he sat there in reverie, Vivien,
daughter of the lord of the manor of Broceliande, came
to the water&rsquo;s edge. Her father had gained the affection
of a fay of the valley, who had promised on behalf of
their daughter that she should be loved by the wisest
man in the world, who should grant all her wishes, but
would never be able to compel her to consent to his.</p>
<p>Vivien reclined upon the other side of the fountain, and
the eyes of the sage and maiden met. At length Merlin
rose to depart, and gave the damsel courteous good-day.
But she, curious and not content with a mere salutation,
wished him all happiness and honour. Her voice
was beautiful, her eyes expressive, and Merlin, moved
beyond anything in his experience, asked her name.
She told him she was a daughter of a gentleman of
that country, and in turn asked him who he might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scholar returning to his master,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Your master? And what may he teach you, young
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He instructs me in the magic art, fair dame,&rdquo; replied
Merlin, amused. &ldquo;By aid of his teaching I can raise a
castle ere a man could count a score, and garrison it
with warriors of might. I can make a river flow past
the spot on which you recline, I can raise spirits from
the great deeps of ether in which this world rolls, and
can peer far into the future&mdash;aye, to the extreme of
human days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that I shared your wisdom!&rdquo; cried Vivien, her
voice thrilling with the desire of hidden things which
she had inherited from her fairy mother. &ldquo;Teach me
these secrets, I entreat of you, noble scholar, and accept
in return for your instruction my most tender friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merlin, willing to please her, arose, and traced certain
mystical characters upon the greensward. Straightway
the glade in which they sat was filled with knights,
ladies, maidens, and esquires, who danced and disported
themselves right joyously. A stately castle rose on the
verge of the forest, and in the garden the spirits whom
Merlin the enchanter had raised up in the semblance
of knights and ladies held carnival. Vivien, delighted,
asked of Merlin in what manner he had achieved this
feat of faÃ«ry, and he told her that he would in time
instruct her as to the manner of accomplishing it. He
then dismissed the spirit attendants and dissipated the
castle into thin air, but retained the garden at the
request of Vivien, naming it &lsquo;Joyous Garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he made a tryst with Vivien to meet her in a year
on the Vigil of St John.</p>

<p class='caption'>
MERLIN AND VIVIEN<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Now Merlin had to be present at the espousal of Arthur,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
his King, with Guinevere, at which he was to assist the
archbishop, Dubric, as priest. The festivities over, he
recalled his promise to Vivien, and on the appointed day
he once more assumed the guise of a travelling scholar
and set out to meet the maiden in the forest of
Broceliande. She awaited him patiently in Joyous
Garden, where they partook of a dainty repast. But
the viands and the wines were wasted upon Merlin, for
Vivien was beside him and she alone filled his thoughts.
She was fair of colour, and fresh with the freshness of
all in the forest, and her hazel eyes made such fire
within his soul that he conceived a madness of love for
her that all his wisdom, deep as it was, could not
control.</p>
<p>But Vivien was calm as a lake circled by trees, where
no breath of the passion of tempest can come. Again
and again she urged him to impart to her the secrets she
so greatly longed to be acquainted with. And chiefly
did she desire to know three things; these at all hazards
must she have power over. How, she asked, could water
be made to flow in a dry place? In what manner could
any form be assumed at will? And, lastly, how could
one be made to fall asleep at the pleasure of another?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore ask you this last question, demoiselle?&rdquo;
said Merlin, suspicious even in his great passion for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that I may cast the spell of sleep over my father
and my mother when I come to you, Merlin,&rdquo; she replied,
with a beguiling glance, &ldquo;for did they know that I loved
you they would slay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merlin hesitated, and so was lost. He imparted to her
that hidden knowledge which she desired. Then they
dwelt together for eight days in the Joyous Garden,
during which time the sage, to Vivien&rsquo;s delight and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
amaze, related to her the marvellous circumstances of
his birth.</p>
<p>Next day Merlin departed, but came again to Broceliande
when the eglantine was flowering at the edge of the
forest. Again he wore the scholar&rsquo;s garments. His
aspect was youthful, his fair hair hung in ringlets on his
shoulders, and he appeared so handsome that a tender
flower of love sprang up in Vivien&rsquo;s heart, and she
felt that she must keep him ever near her. But she
knew full well that he whom she loved was in reality
well stricken in years, and she was sorrowful. But
she did not despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beloved,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;will you grant me but one
other boon? There is one secret more that I desire to
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Merlin knew well ere she spoke what was in her
mind, and he sighed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore do you sigh?&rdquo; she asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sigh because my fate is strong upon me,&rdquo; replied the
sage. &ldquo;For it was foreseen in the long ago that a lady
should lead me captive and that I should become her
prisoner for all time. Neither have I the power to deny
you what you ask of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vivien embraced him rapturously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Merlin, beloved, is it not that you should always
be with me?&rdquo; she asked passionately. &ldquo;For your sake
have I not given up father and mother, and are not all
my thoughts and desires toward you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merlin, carried away by her amorous eloquence, could
only answer: &ldquo;It is yours to ask what you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vivien then revealed to him her wish. She longed to
learn from his lips an enchantment which would keep
him ever near her, which would so bind him to her in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
the chains of love that nothing in the world could part
him from her. Hearkening to her plea, he taught her
such enchantment as would render him love&rsquo;s prisoner
for ever.</p>
<p>Evening was shrouding the forest in soft shadows
when Merlin sank to rest. Vivien, waiting until his
deep and regular breathing told her that he was asleep,
walked nine times around him, waving her cloak over
his head, and muttering the mysterious words he had
taught her. When the sage awoke he found himself
in the Joyous Garden with Vivien by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mine for ever,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You can
never leave me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My delight will be ever to stay with you,&rdquo; he replied,
enraptured. &ldquo;And oh, beloved, never leave me, I pray
you, for I am bespelled so as to love you throughout
eternity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never shall I leave you,&rdquo; she replied; and in such
manner the wise Merlin withdrew from the world of
men to remain ever in the Joyous Garden with Vivien.
Love had triumphed over wisdom.</p>
<p>The Arthurian version of the story does not, of course,
represent Vivien as does the old Breton legend. In
Geoffrey of Monmouth&rsquo;s book and in the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>
she is drawn as the scheming enchantress who wishes to
lure Merlin to his ruin for the joy of being able to boast
of her conquest. In some romances she is alluded to
as Nimue, and in others is described as the daughter of
Dyonas, who perhaps is the same as Dylan, a Brythonic
(British) sea-god. As the Lady of the Lake she is the
foster-mother of Lancelot, and we should have no difficulty
in classing her as a water deity or spirit very much
like the Korrigan.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<h3><i>Merlin</i></h3>
<p>But Merlin is a very different character, and it is probable
that the story of his love for Vivien was composed
at a comparatively late date for the purpose of rounding
off his fate in Arthurian legend. A recent hypothesis
concerning him is to the effect that &ldquo;if he belongs to
the pagan period [of Celtic lore] at all, he was probably
an ideal magician or god of magicians.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0027' id='FNanchor_0027'></a><a href='#Footnote_0027' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> Canon
MacCulloch smiles at the late Sir John Rhys&rsquo;s belief
that Merlin was &ldquo;a Celtic Zeus,&rdquo; but his later suggestion
seems equally debatable. We must remember that we
draw our conception of Merlin as Arthurian archimagus
chiefly from late Norman-French sources and Celtic
tradition. Ancient Brythonic traditions concerning
beings of much the same type as Merlin appear to have
existed, however, and the character of Lailoken in
the life of St Kentigern recalls his life-story. So far
research on the subject seems to show that the legend
of Merlin is a thing of complex growth, composed of
traditions of independent and widely differing origin,
most of which were told about Celtic bards and soothsayers.
Merlin is, in fact, the typical Druid or wise
man of Celtic tradition, and there is not the slightest
reason for believing that he was ever paid divine
honours. As a soothsayer of legend, he would assuredly
belong to the pagan period, however much
he is indebted to Geoffrey of Monmouth for his late
popularity in pure romance.</p>
<h3><i>The Fountain of Baranton</i></h3>
<p>In the country of Broceliande lies the magic fountain of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Baranton, sequestered among hills and surrounded by
deep woods. Says a thirteenth-century writer of this
fountain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, amazing wonder of the Fountain of Brecelien!
If a drop be taken and poured on a certain rock beside
the spring, immediately the water changes into vapour,
forms itself into great clouds filled with hail; the air
becomes thick with shadows, and resonant with the
muttering of thunder. Those who have come through
curiosity to behold the prodigy wish that they had never
done so, so filled are their hearts with terror, and so
does fear paralyse their limbs. Incredible as the marvel
may seem, yet the proofs of its reality are too abundant
to be doubted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huon de MÃ©ry was more fortunate than Wace. He
sprinkled the magic stone which lay behind the fountain
with water from the golden basin that hung from the
oak that shaded it, and beheld many marvels. And so
may he who has the seeing eye to-day.</p>
<h4>BROCELIANDE</h4>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<h3><i>Bruno of La Montagne</i></h3>
<p>The old fragmentary romance of Bruno of La Montagne
is eloquent of the faÃ«ry spirit which informs all Breton
lore. Butor, Baron of La Montagne, had married a
young lady when he was himself of mature years, and
had a son, whom he resolved to take to a fountain
where the fairies came to repose themselves. The
Baron, describing this magic well to the child&rsquo;s mother,
says (we roughly translate):</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Some believe &rsquo;tis in Champagne,</p>
<p>And others by the Rock Grifaigne;</p>
<p>Perchance it is in Alemaigne,</p>
<p>Or Bersillant de la Montagne;</p>
<p>Some even think that &rsquo;tis in Spain,</p>
<p>Or where sleeps Artus of Bretaigne.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The Seigneur gave his infant son into the keeping of
Bruyant, a trusty friend of his, and they set out for
the fairy fountain with a troop of vassals. They left
the infant in the forest of Broceliande. Here the fairies
soon found him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, sisters,&rdquo; said one whose skin was as white as
the robe of gossamer she wore, and whose golden
crown betokened her the queen of the others, &ldquo;come
hither and see a new-born infant. How, I wonder,
does he come to be here? I am sure I did not behold
him in this spot yesterday. Well, at all events, he
must be baptized and suitably endowed, as is our
custom when we discover a mortal child. Now what
will you give him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give him,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;beauty and grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I endow him,&rdquo; said a second, &ldquo;with generosity.&rdquo;</p>

THE FAIRIES OF BROCELIANDE FIND THE LITTLE BRUNO<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;with such valour that he will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
overthrow all his enemies at tourney and on the battlefield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen listened to these promises. &ldquo;Surely you
have little sense,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For my part, I wish
that in his youth he may love one who will be utterly
insensible to him, and although he will be as you desire,
noble, generous, beautiful, and valorous, he will yet, for
his good, suffer keenly from the anguish of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Queen,&rdquo; said one of the fairies, &ldquo;what a cruel fate
you have ordained for this unfortunate child! But I
myself shall watch over him and nurse him until he
comes to such an age as he may love, when I myself
will try to engage his affections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I will not alter my
design. You shall not nurse this infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fairies then disappeared. Shortly afterward
Bruyant returned, and carried the child back to the
castle of La Montagne, where presently a fairy presented
herself as nurse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the manuscript from which this tale is
taken breaks off at this point, and we do not know
how the Fairy Queen succeeded with her plans for
the amorous education of the little Bruno. But the
fragment, although tantalizing in the extreme, gives
us some insight into the nature of the fairies who
inhabit the green fastnesses of Broceliande.</p>
<h3><i>Fairies in Folk-lore</i></h3>
<p>Nearly all fairy-folk have in time grown to mortal
height. Whether fairies be the decayed poor relations
of more successful deities, gods whose cult has been forgotten
and neglected (as the Irish <i>Sidhe</i>, or fairy-folk),
or diminutive animistic spirits, originating in the belief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
that every object, small or great, possessed a personality,
it is noticeable that Celtic fairies are of human height,
while those of the Teutonic peoples are usually dwarfish.
Titania may come originally from the loins of Titans
or she may be Diana come down in the world, and
Oberon may hail from a very different and more dwarfish
source, but in Shakespeare&rsquo;s England they have grown
sufficiently to permit them to tread the boards of the
Globe Theatre with normal humans. Scores of fairies
mate with mortal men, and men, as a rule, do not care
for dwarf-wives. Among Celts, at least, the fay, whatever
her original stature, in later times had certainly
achieved the height of mortal womanhood.</p>
<p>In Upper Brittany, where French is the language in
general use, the usual French ideas concerning fairies
prevail. They are called <i>fÃ©es</i> or <i>fetes</i> (Latin <i>fata</i>), and
sometimes <i>fions</i>, which reminds us of the <i>fions</i> of Scottish
and Irish folk-lore.<a name='FNanchor_0028' id='FNanchor_0028'></a><a href='#Footnote_0028' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> There are old people still alive who
claim to have seen the fairies, and who describe them
variously, but the general belief seems to be that they
disappeared from the land several generations ago. One
old man described them as having teeth as long as one&rsquo;s
hand, and as wearing garments of sea-weed or leaves.
They were human in aspect, said another ancient whom
SÃ©billot questioned; their clothes were seamless, and it
was impossible to say by merely looking at them whether
they were male or female. Their garments were of the
most brilliant colours imaginable, but if one approached
them too closely these gaudy hues disappeared. They
wore a kind of bonnet shaped like a crown, which
appeared to be part of their person.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>The people of the coast say that the fairies are an
accursed race who are condemned to walk the earth for
a certain space. Some even think them rebellious angels
who have been sent to earth for a time to expiate their
offences against heaven. For the most part they inhabit
the dolmens and the grottos and caverns on the coast.<a name='FNanchor_0029' id='FNanchor_0029'></a><a href='#Footnote_0029' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a></p>
<p>On the shores of the Channel are numerous grottos or
caverns which the Bretons call <i>houles</i>, and these are
supposed to harbour a distinct class of fairy. Some of
these caverns are from twenty to thirty feet high, and
so extensive that it is unwise to explore them too far.
Others seem only large enough to hold a single person,
but if one enters he will find himself in a spacious natural
chamber. The inhabitants of these depths, like all their
kind, prefer to sally forth by night rather than by day.
In the day-time they are not seen because they smear
themselves with a magic ointment which renders them
invisible; but at night they are visible to everybody.</p>
<h3><i>The Lost Daughter</i></h3>
<p>There was once upon a time a labourer of Saint-Cast
named Marc Bourdais, but, according to the usage of
the country, he had a nickname and was called Maraud.
One day he was returning home when he heard the
sound of a horn beneath his feet, and asked a companion
who chanced to be with him if he had heard it also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; replied the fellow; &ldquo;it is a fairy
horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph,&rdquo; said Maraud. &ldquo;Ask the fairies, then, to
bring us a slice of bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion knelt down and shouted out the request,
but nothing happened and they resumed their way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>They had not gone far, however, when they beheld a
slice of beautiful white bread lying on a snowy napkin
by the roadside. Maraud picked it up and found that it
was well buttered and as toothsome as a cake, and when
they had divided and eaten it they felt their hunger
completely satisfied. But he who has fed well is often
thirsty, so Maraud, lowering his head, and speaking to
the little folk beneath, cried: &ldquo;Hullo, there! Bring us
something to drink, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when they beheld a pot of cider
and a glass reposing on the ground in front of them.
Maraud filled the glass, and, raising it to his lips, quaffed
of the fairy cider. It was clear and of a rich colour, and
he declared that it was by far the best that he had
ever tasted. His friend drank likewise, and when they
returned to the village that night they had a good story
to tell of how they had eaten and drunk at the expense
of the fairies. But their friends and neighbours shook
their heads and regarded them sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! poor fellows,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;if you have eaten
fairy food and drunk fairy liquor you are as good as
dead men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing happened to them within the next few days,
however, and it was with light hearts that one morning
they returned to work in the neighbourhood of the
spot where they had met with such a strange adventure.
When they arrived at the place they smelt the odour
of cakes which had been baked with black corn, and a
fierce hunger at once took possession of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Maraud, &ldquo;the fairies are baking to-day.
Suppose we ask them for a cake or two.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
replied his friend. &ldquo;Ask them if you wish, but I will
have none of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; cried Maraud, &ldquo;what are you afraid of?&rdquo; And
he cried: &ldquo;Below there! Bring me a cake, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two fine cakes at once appeared. Maraud seized upon
one, but when he had cut it he perceived that it was
made of hairs, and he threw it down in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wicked old sorcerer!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you mean
to mock me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as he spoke the cakes disappeared.</p>
<p>Now there lived in the village a widow with seven
children, and a hard task she had to find bread for them
all. She heard tell of Maraud&rsquo;s adventure with the
fairies, and pondered on the chance of receiving a like
hospitality from them, that the seven little mouths she
had to provide for might be filled. So she made up her
mind to go to a fairy grotto she knew of and ask for
bread. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;what the good people
give to others who do not require it they will give to
me, whose need is so great.&rdquo; When she had come to
the entrance of the grotto she knocked on the side
of it as one knocks on a door, and there at once
appeared a little old dame with a great bunch of keys
hanging at her side. She appeared to be covered with
limpets, and mould and moss clung to her as to a rock.
To the widow she seemed at least a thousand years
old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you desire, my good woman?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! madame,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;might I have a little
bread for my seven children? Give me some, I beseech
you, and I will remember you in my prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the mistress here,&rdquo; replied the old woman.
&ldquo;I am only the porteress, and it is at least a hundred
years since I have been out. But return to-morrow
and I will promise to speak for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>Next day at the same time the widow returned to the
cave, and found the old porteress waiting for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken for you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and here is a loaf
of bread for you, and those who send it wish to speak
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me to them,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;that I may
thank them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; replied the porteress. &ldquo;Return to-morrow
at the same hour and I will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow returned to the village and told her neighbours
of her success. Every one came to see the fairy
loaf, and many begged a piece.</p>
<p>Next day the poor woman returned to the grotto in the
hope that she would once more benefit from the little
folks&rsquo; bounty. The porteress was there as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my good woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;did you find my
bread to your taste? Here is the lady who has befriended
you,&rdquo; and she indicated a beautiful lady, who
came smilingly from the darkness of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;I thank you with all
my heart for your charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loaf will last a long time,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;and
you will find that you and your family will not readily
finish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;last night all my neighbours
insisted on having a piece, so that it is now entirely
eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the fay, &ldquo;I will give you another loaf.
So long as you or your children partake of it it will not
grow smaller and will always remain fresh, but if you
should give the least morsel to a stranger the loaf will
disappear. But as I have helped you, so must you help
me. I have four cows, and I wish to send them out to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
pasture. Promise me that one of your daughters will
guard them for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow promised, and next morning sent one of
her daughters out to look for the cows, which were to be
pastured in a field where there was but little herbage.
A neighbour saw her there, and asked what she was
doing in that deserted place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am watching the fairy cows,&rdquo; replied she. The
woman looked at her and smiled, for there were no
cows there and she thought the girl had become half-witted.</p>
<p>With the evening the fairy of the grotto came herself
to fetch the cows, and she said to the little cowherd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to be godmother to my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a pleasure, madame,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say nothing to any one, not even to your
mother,&rdquo; replied the fairy, &ldquo;for if you do I shall never
bring you anything more to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days afterward a fairy came to tell the girl to
prepare to come to the cavern on the morrow, as on
that day the infant was to be named. Next day,
according to the fairy&rsquo;s instructions, she presented herself
at the mouth of the grotto, and in due course was
made godmother to the little fairy. For two days she
remained there, and when she left her godchild was
already grown up. She had, as a matter of fact, unconsciously
remained with the &lsquo;good people&rsquo; for ten
years, and her mother had long mourned her as dead.
Meanwhile the fairies had requested the poor widow to
send another of her daughters to watch their cows.</p>
<p>When at last the absent one returned to the village she
went straight home, and her mother on beholding her
gave a great cry. The girl could not understand her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
agitation, believing as she did that she had been absent
for two days only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days!&rdquo; echoed the mother. &ldquo;You have been
away ten years! Look how you have grown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had overcome her surprise the girl resumed
her household duties as if nothing particular had
happened, and knitted a pair of stockings for her
godchild. When they were finished she carried
them to the fairy grotto, where, as she thought, she
spent the afternoon. But in reality she had been away
from home this time for five years. As she was leaving,
her godchild gave her a purse, saying: &ldquo;This purse is
full of gold. Whenever you take a piece out another
one will come in its place, but if any one else uses it
it will lose all its virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girl returned to the village at last it was to
find her mother dead, her brothers gone abroad, and
her sisters married, so that she was the only one left
at home. As she was pretty and a good housewife she
did not want for lovers, and in due time she chose one
for a husband. She did not tell her spouse about the
purse she had had from the fairies, and if she wanted
to give him a piece of gold she withdrew it from the
magic purse in secret. She never went back to the
fairy cavern, as she had no mind to return from it and
find her husband an old man.</p>
<h3><i>The Fisherman and the Fairies</i></h3>
<p>A fisherman of Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, walking home to
his cottage from his boat one evening along the wet
sands, came, unawares, upon a number of fairies in a
<i>houle</i>. They were talking and laughing gaily, and the
fisherman observed that while they made merry they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
rubbed their bodies with a kind of ointment or pomade.
All at once, to the old salt&rsquo;s surprise, they turned into
ordinary women. Concealing himself behind a rock,
the fisherman watched them until the now completely
transformed immortals quitted their haunt and waddled
away in the guise of old market-women.</p>

<p class='caption'>
FAIRIES IN A BRETON &lsquo;HOULE&rsquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The fisherman waited until they were well out of sight,
and then entered the cavern, where the first object that
met his gaze was the pot of ointment which had effected
the marvellous change he had witnessed. Taking some
of the pomade on his forefinger, he smeared it around
his left eye. He afterward found that he could penetrate
the various disguises assumed by the fairies
wherever he met them, and that these were for the
most part adopted for the purposes of trickery. Thus
he was able to see a fairy in the assumed shape of a
beggar-woman going from door to door demanding alms,
seeking an opportunity to steal or work mischief, and
all the while casting spells upon those who were charitable
enough to assist her. Again, he could distinguish real
fish caught in his net at sea from merwomen disguised
as fish, who were desirous of entangling the nets or
otherwise distressing and annoying the fishermen.</p>
<p>But nowhere was the disguised fairy race so much in
evidence as at the fair of Ploubalay, where he recognized
several of the elusive folk in the semblance of raree-showmen,
fortune-tellers, and the like, who had taken
these shapes in order to deceive. He was quietly
smiling at their pranks, when some of the fairies who
composed a troupe of performers in front of one of the
booths regarded him very earnestly. He felt certain
that they had penetrated his secret, but ere he could
make off one of them threw a stick at him with such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
violence that it struck and burst the offending left
eye.</p>
<p>Fairies in all lands have a constitutional distaste for being
recognized, but those of Brittany appear to visit their
vengeance upon the members with which they are actually
beheld. &ldquo;See what thieves the fairies are!&rdquo; cried a
woman, on beholding one abstract apples from a countrywoman&rsquo;s
pocket. The predatory elf at once turned
round and tore out the eye that had marked his act.</p>
<p>A Cornish woman who chanced to find herself the
guardian of an elf-child was given certain water with
which to wash its face. The liquid had the property
of illuminating the infant&rsquo;s face with a supernatural
brightness, and the woman ventured to try it upon
herself, and in doing so splashed a little into one eye.
This gave her the fairy sight. One day in the market-place
she saw a fairy man stealing, and gave the alarm,
when the enraged sprite cried:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Water for elf, not water for self.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost your eye, your child, and yourself.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>She was immediately stricken blind in the right eye,
her fairy foster-child vanished, and she and her husband
sank into poverty and want.</p>
<p>Another Breton tale recounts how a mortal woman was
given a polished stone in the form of an egg wherewith
to rub a fairy child&rsquo;s eyes. She applied it to her own
right eye, and became possessed of magic sight so far
as elves were concerned. Still another case, alluded to
in the <i>Revue Celtique</i>,<a name='FNanchor_0030' id='FNanchor_0030'></a><a href='#Footnote_0030' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a> arose through &lsquo;the sacred bond&rsquo;
formed between a fairy man and a mortal woman where
both stood as godparents to a child. The association
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
enabled the woman to see magically. The fairy maiden
Rockflower bestows a similar gift on her lover in a
Breton tale from Saint-Cast, and speaks of &ldquo;clearing
his eyes like her own.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0031' id='FNanchor_0031'></a><a href='#Footnote_0031' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a></p>
<h3><i>Changelings</i></h3>
<p>The Breton fairies, like others of their race, are fond of
kidnapping mortal children and leaving in their places
wizened elves who cause the greatest trouble to the
distressed parents. The usual method of ridding a
family of such a changeling is to surprise it in some
manner so that it will betray its true character. Thus,
on suspicion resting upon a certain Breton infant who
showed every sign of changeling nature, milk was boiled
on the fire in egg-shells, whereupon the impish youngster
cried: &ldquo;I shall soon be a hundred years old, but I never
saw so many shells boiling! I was born in Pif and Paf,
in the country where cats are made, but I never saw
anything like it!&rdquo; Thus self-revealed, the elf was
expelled from the house. In most Northern tales where
the changeling betrays itself it at once takes flight and
a train of elves appears, bringing back the true infant.
Again, if the wizened occupant of the cradle can be
made to laugh that is accepted as proof of its fairy
nature. &ldquo;Something ridiculous,&rdquo; says Simrock, &ldquo;must
be done to cause him to laugh, for laughter brings
deliverance.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0032' id='FNanchor_0032'></a><a href='#Footnote_0032' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a> The same stratagem appears to be used
as the cure in English and Scots changeling tales.</p>
<h3><i>The King of the Fishes</i></h3>
<p>The Breton fays were prone, too, to take the shape of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
animals, birds, and even of fish. As we have seen, the
sea-fairies of Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer were in the habit of
taking the shape of fish for the purpose of annoying
fishermen and damaging their gear. Another Breton
tale from Saint-Cast illustrates their penchant for the
fish shape. A fisherman of that town one day was
lucky enough to catch the King of the Fishes disguised
as a small golden fish. The fish begged hard to be
released, and promised, if he were set free, to sacrifice
as many of his subjects as would daily fill the fisherman&rsquo;s
nets. On this understanding the finny monarch
was given his liberty, and fulfilled his promise to the
letter. Moreover, when the fisherman&rsquo;s boat was
capsized in a gale the Fish King appeared, and, holding
a flask to the drowning man&rsquo;s lips, made him drink a
magic fluid which ensured his ability to exist under
water. He conveyed the fisherman to his capital, a
place of dazzling splendour, paved with gold and gems.
The rude caster of nets instantly filled his pockets with
the spoil of this marvellous causeway. Though probably
rather disturbed by the incident, the Fish King, with
true royal politeness, informed him that whenever
he desired to return the way was open to him. The
fisherman expressed his sorrow at having to leave such
a delightful environment, but added that unless he
returned to earth his wife and family would regard
him as lost. The Fish King called a large tunny-fish,
and as Arion mounted the dolphin in the old
Argolian tale, so the fisherman approached the tunny,
which</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Hollowed his back and shaped it as a selle.<a name='FNanchor_0033' id='FNanchor_0033'></a><a href='#Footnote_0033' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a></p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>The fisherman at once</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Seized the strange sea-steed by his bristling fin</p>
<p>And vaulted on his shoulders; the fleet fish</p>
<p>Swift sought the shallows and the friendly shore.<a name='FNanchor_0034' id='FNanchor_0034'></a><a href='#Footnote_0034' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a></p>
</div></div>
<p>Before dismissing the fisherman, however, the Fish
King presented him with an inexhaustible purse&mdash;probably
as a hint that it would be unnecessary for him
on a future visit to disturb his paving arrangements.</p>
<h3><i>Fairy Origins</i></h3>
<p>Two questions which early obtrude themselves in the
consideration of Breton fairy-lore are: Are all the
fays of Brittany malevolent? And, if so, whence proceeds
this belief that fairy-folk are necessarily malign?
Example treads upon example to prove that the Breton
fairy is seldom beneficent, that he or she is prone to
ill-nature and spitefulness, not to say fiendish malice on
occasion. There appears to be a deep-rooted conviction
that the elfish race devotes itself to the annoyance
of mankind, practising a species of peculiarly irritating
trickery, wanton and destructive. Only very rarely is
a spirit of friendliness evinced, and then a motive
is usually obvious. The &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; fairy invariably has
an axe to grind.</p>
<p>Two reasons may be advanced to account for this
condition of things. First, the fairy-folk&mdash;in which are
included house and field spirits&mdash;may be the traditional
remnant of a race of real people, perhaps a prehistoric
race, driven into the remote parts of the country by
strange immigrant conquerors. Perhaps these primitive
folk were elfish, dwarfish, or otherwise peculiar in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
appearance to the superior new-comers, who would in
pride of race scorn the small, swarthy aborigines, and
refuse all communion with them. We may be sure that
the aborigines, on their part, would feel for their tall,
handsome conquerors all the hatred of which a subject
race is capable, never approaching them unless under
compulsion or necessity, and revenging themselves
upon them by every means of annoyance in their power.
We may feel certain, too, that the magic of these conquered
and discredited folk would be made full use of
to plague the usurpers of the soil, and trickery, as irritating
as any elf-pranks, would be brought to increase
the discomfort of the new-comers.</p>
<p>There are, however, several good objections to this
view of the origin of the fairy idea. First and foremost,
the smaller prehistoric aboriginal peoples of
Europe themselves possessed tales of little people, of
spirits of field and forest, flood and fell. It is unlikely
that man was ever without these.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Yea, I sang, as now I sing, when the Prehistoric Spring</p>
<p>Made the piled Biscayan ice-pack split and shove,</p>
<p>And the troll, and gnome, and dwerg, and the gods of cliff and berg</p>
<p>Were about me and beneath me and above.<a name='FNanchor_0035' id='FNanchor_0035'></a><a href='#Footnote_0035' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a></p>
</div></div>
<p>The idea of animism, the belief that everything had a
personality of its own, certainly belonged to the later
prehistoric period, for among the articles which fill
the graves of aboriginal peoples, for use on the last
journey, we find weapons to enable the deceased
to drive off the evil spirits which would surround his
own after death. Spirits, to early man, are always relatively
smaller than himself. He beholds the &ldquo;picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
of a little man&rdquo; in his comrade&rsquo;s eyes, and concludes
it to be his &lsquo;soul.&rsquo; Some primitive peoples, indeed,
believe that several parts of the body have each their
own resident soul. Again, the spirit of the corn or the
spirit of the flower, the savage would argue, must in the
nature of things be small. We can thus see how the
belief in &lsquo;the little folk&rsquo; may have arisen, and how they
remained little until a later day.</p>
<p>A much more scientific theory of the origin of the belief
in fairies is that which sees in them the deities of a
discredited religion, the gods of an aboriginal people,
rather than the people themselves. Such were the
Irish <i>Daoine Sidhe</i>, and the Welsh <i>y Mamau</i> (&lsquo;the
Mothers&rsquo;)&mdash;undoubtedly gods of the Celts. Again,
although in many countries, especially in England, the
fairies are regarded as small of stature, in Celtic countries
the fay proper, as distinct from the brownie and such
goblins, is of average mortal height, and this would
seem to be the case in Brittany. Whether the gorics
and courils of Brittany, who seem sufficiently small, are
fairies or otherwise is a moot point. They seem
to be more of the field spirit type, and are perhaps
classed more correctly with the gnome race; we thus
deal with them in our chapter on sprites and demons.
It would seem, too, as if there might be ground for
the belief that the normal-sized fairy race of Celtic
countries had become confounded with the Teutonic idea
of elves (Teut. <i>Elfen</i>) in Germany and England, from
which, perhaps, they borrowed their diminutive size.</p>
<p>But these are only considerations, not conclusions.
Strange as it may seem, folk-lore has by no means solved
the fairy problem, and much remains to be accomplished
ere we can write &lsquo;Finis&rsquo; to the study of fairy origins.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<h3><i>The Margots</i></h3>
<p>Another Breton name for the fairies is <i>les Margots la
fÃ©e</i>, a title which is chiefly employed in several districts
of the CÃ´tes-du-Nord, principally in the <i>arrondissements</i>
of Saint-Brieuc and LoudÃ©ac, to describe those fairies
who have their abode in large rocks and on the wild
and extensive moorlands which are so typical of the
country. These, unlike the <i>fÃ©es houles</i>, are able to
render themselves invisible at pleasure. Like human
beings, they are subject to maladies, and are occasionally
glad to accept mortal succour. They return kindness
for kindness, but are vindictive enemies to those
who attempt to harm them.</p>
<p>But fairy vindictiveness is not lavished upon those
unwitting mortals who do them harm alone. If one
chances to succeed in a task set by the immortals of
the forest, one is in danger of death, as the following
story shows.</p>
<h3><i>The Boy who Served the Fairies</i></h3>
<p>A poor little fellow was one day gathering faggots in
the forest when a gay, handsomely dressed gentleman
passed him, and, noticing the lad&rsquo;s ragged and forlorn
condition, said to him: &ldquo;What are you doing there,
my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for wood, sir,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;If I
did not do so we should have no fire at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very poor at home, then?&rdquo; asked the
gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So poor,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;that sometimes we only eat
once a day, and often go supperless to bed.&rdquo;</p>

THE POOR BOY AND THE THREE FAIRY DAMSELS<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a sad tale,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;If you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
will promise to meet me here within a month I will
give you some money, which will help your parents
and feed and clothe your small brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prompt to the day and the hour, the boy kept the
tryst in the forest glade, at the very spot where he had
met the gentleman. But though he looked anxiously
on every side he could see no signs of his friend. In
his anxiety he pushed farther into the forest, and came
to the borders of a pond, where three damsels were
preparing to bathe. One was dressed in white, another
in grey, and the third in blue. The boy pulled off his
cap, gave them good-day, and asked politely if they
had not seen a gentleman in the neighbourhood. The
maiden who was dressed in white told him where the
gentleman was to be found, and pointed out a road by
which he might arrive at his castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will ask you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to become his servant,
and if you accept he will wish you to eat. The first
time that he presents the food to you, say: &lsquo;It is I who
should serve you.&rsquo; If he asks you a second time make
the same reply; but if he should press you a third
time refuse brusquely and thrust away the plate which
he offers you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was not long in finding the castle, and was
at once shown into the gentleman&rsquo;s presence. As the
maiden dressed in white had foretold, he requested
the youth to enter his service, and when his offer was
accepted placed before him a plate of viands. The
lad bowed politely, but refused the food. A second
time it was offered, but he persisted in his refusal,
and when it was proffered to him a third time he thrust
it away from him so roughly that it fell to the ground
and the plate was broken.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;you are just the kind of
servant I require. You are now my lackey, and if you
are able to do three things that I command you I will
give you one of my daughters for your wife and you
shall be my son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day he gave the boy a hatchet of lead, a
saw of paper, and a wheelbarrow made of oak-leaves,
bidding him fell, bind up, and measure all the wood
in the forest within a radius of seven leagues. The
new servant at once commenced his task, but the
hatchet of lead broke at the first blow, the saw of
paper buckled at the first stroke, and the wheelbarrow
of oak-leaves was broken by the weight of the first
little branch he placed on it. The lad in despair sat
down, and could do nothing but gaze at the useless
implements. At midday the damsel dressed in white
whom he had seen at the pond came to bring him
something to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why do you sit thus idle? If my
father should come and find that you have done nothing
he would kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing with such wretched tools,&rdquo; grumbled
the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see this wand?&rdquo; said the damsel, producing
a little rod. &ldquo;Take it in your hand and walk round
the forest, and the work will take care of itself. At
the same time say these words: &lsquo;Let the wood fall,
tie itself into bundles, and be measured.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did as the damsel advised him, and matters
proceeded so satisfactorily that by a little after midday
the work was completed. In the evening the gentleman
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you accomplished your task?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Do you wish to see it? The wood is
cut and tied into bundles of the proper weight and
measurement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;To-morrow I will
set you the second task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following morning he took the lad to a knoll
some distance from the castle, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see this rising ground? By this evening you
must have made it a garden well planted with fruit-trees
and having a fish-pond in the middle, where
ducks and other water-fowl may swim. Here are your
tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tools were a pick of glass and a spade of earthenware.
The boy commenced the work, but at the first
stroke his fragile pick and spade broke into a thousand
fragments. For the second time he sat down helplessly.
Time passed slowly, and as before at midday the damsel
in white brought him his dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I find you once more with your arms folded,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot work with a pick of glass and an earthenware
spade,&rdquo; complained the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is another wand,&rdquo; said the damsel. &ldquo;Take it
and walk round this knoll, saying: &lsquo;Let the place be
planted and become a beautiful garden with fruit-trees,
in the middle of which is a fish-pond with ducks swimming
upon it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy took the wand, did as he was bid, and the work
was speedily accomplished. A beautiful garden arose
as if by enchantment, well furnished with fruit-trees of
all descriptions and ornamented with a small sheet of
water.</p>
<p>Once more his master was quite satisfied with the result,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and on the third morning set him his third task. He
took him beneath one of the towers of the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold this tower,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is of polished
marble. You must climb it, and at the top you will
find a turtle-dove, which you must bring to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman, who was of opinion that the damsel
in white had helped his servant in the first two tasks,
sent her to the town to buy provisions. When she
received this order the maiden retired to her chamber
and burst into tears. Her sisters asked her what was
the matter, and she told them that she wished to remain
at the castle, so they promised to go to the town in her
stead. At midday she found the lad sitting at the foot
of the tower bewailing the fact that he could not climb
its smooth and glassy sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to help you once more,&rdquo; said the damsel.
&ldquo;You must get a cauldron, then cut me into morsels and
throw in all my bones, without missing a single one.
It is the only way to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth. &ldquo;I would sooner die
than harm such a beautiful lady as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you must do as I say,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>For a long time the youth refused, but at last he gave
way to the maiden&rsquo;s entreaties, cut her into little pieces,
and placed the bones in a large cauldron, forgetting,
however, the little toe of her left foot. Then he rose as
if by magic to the top of the tower, found the turtle-dove,
and came down again.<a name='FNanchor_0036' id='FNanchor_0036'></a><a href='#Footnote_0036' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> Having completed his task, he
took a wand which lay beside the cauldron, and when
he touched the bones they came together again and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
damsel stepped out of the great pot none the worse for
her experience.</p>
<p>When the young fellow carried the dove to his master
the gentleman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well. I shall carry out my promise and give you
one of my daughters for your wife, but all three shall be
veiled and you must pick the one you desire without
seeing her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three damsels were then brought into his presence,
but the lad easily recognized the one who had assisted
him, because she lacked the small toe of the left foot.
So he chose her without hesitation, and they were
married.</p>
<p>But the gentleman was not content with the marriage.
On the day of the bridal he placed the bed of the young
folks over a vault, and hung it from the roof by four
cords. When they had gone to bed he came to the
door of the chamber and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son-in-law, are you asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p>
<p>Some time afterward he repeated his question, and met
with a similar answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next time he comes,&rdquo; said the bride, &ldquo;pretend
that you are sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after that his father-in-law asked once more if he
were asleep, and receiving no answer retired, evidently
well satisfied.</p>
<p>When he had gone the bride made her husband rise at
once. &ldquo;Go instantly to the stables,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
take there the horse which is called Little Wind, mount
him, and fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young fellow hastened to comply with her request,
and he had scarcely left the chamber when the master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
of the castle returned and asked if his daughter were
asleep. She answered &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and, bidding her arise
and come with him, he cut the cords, so that the bed
fell into the vault beneath. The bride now heard the
trampling of hoofs in the garden outside, and rushed out
to find her husband in the act of mounting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You have taken Great Wind
instead of Little Wind, as I advised you, but there is no
help for it,&rdquo; and she mounted behind him. Great Wind
did not belie his name, and dashed into the night like a
tempest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; said her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you see anything now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I see a great flame of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bride took her wand, struck it three times, and said:
&ldquo;I change thee, Great Wind, into a garden, myself into
a pear-tree, and my husband into a gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transformation had hardly been effected when the
master of the castle and his wife came up with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, my good man,&rdquo; cried he to the seeming gardener,
&ldquo;has any one on horseback passed this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three pears for a sou,&rdquo; said the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not an answer to my question,&rdquo; fumed the old
wizard, for such he was. &ldquo;I asked if you had seen any
one on horseback in this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four for a sou, then, if you will,&rdquo; said the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; foamed the enchanter, and dashed on in
pursuit. The young wife then changed herself, her
horse, and her husband into their natural forms, and,
mounting once more, they rode onward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything now?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see a great flame of fire,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>Once more she took her wand. &ldquo;I change this steed
into a church,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;myself into an altar, and my
husband into a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soon the wizard and his wife came to the doors of
the church and asked the priest if a youth and a lady
had passed that way on horseback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dominus vobiscum,&rdquo; said the priest, and nothing more
could the wizard get from him.</p>
<p>Pursued once more, the young wife changed the horse
into a river, herself into a boat, and her husband
into a boatman. When the wizard came up with them
he asked to be ferried across the river. The boatman
at once made room for them, but in the middle of the
stream the boat capsized and the enchanter and his wife
were drowned.</p>
<p>The young lady and her husband returned to the castle,
seized the treasure of its fairy lord, and, says tradition,
lived happily ever afterward, as all young spouses do in
fairy-tale.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV: SPRITES AND DEMONS OF BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> idea of the evil spirit, malicious and revengeful,
is common to all primitive peoples, and
Brittany has its full share of demonology.
Wherever, in fact, a primitive and illiterate peasantry is
found the demon is its inevitable accompaniment. But
we shall not find these Breton devils so very different
from the fiends of other lands.</p>
<h3><i>The Nain</i></h3>
<p>The nain is a figure fearsomely Celtic in its hideousness,
resembling the gargoyles which peer down upon the
traveller from the carven &lsquo;top-hamper&rsquo; of so many
Breton churches. Black and menacing of countenance,
these demon-folk are armed with feline claws, and their
feet end in hoofs like those of a satyr. Their dark elf-locks,
small, gleaming eyes, red as carbuncles, and harsh,
cracked voices are all dilated upon with fear by those
who have met them upon lonely heaths or unfrequented
roads. They haunt the ancient dolmens built by a
vanished race, and at night, by the pale starlight, they
dance around these ruined tombs to the music of a
primitive refrain:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,</p>
<p>Thursday and Friday.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Saturday and Sunday they dare not mention as being
days sacred from fairy influence. We all remember
that in the old tale of Tom Thumb the elves among
whom the hero fell sang such a refrain. But wherefore?
It would indeed be difficult to say. Deities, credited and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
discredited, have often a connexion with the calendar,
and we may have here some calendric reference, or
again the chant may be merely a nonsense rhyme.
Bad luck attached itself to the human who chanced
to behold the midnight revels of the nains, and if he
entered the charmed circle and danced along with them
his death was certain to ensue before the year was out.
Wednesday was the nains&rsquo; high-day, or rather night,
and their great <i>nuit festale</i> was the first Wednesday in
May. That they should have possessed a fixed festival
at such a period, full of religious significance for most
primitive peoples, would seem to show that they must at
one time have been held in considerable esteem.</p>
<p>But although the nains while away their time in such
simple fashion as dancing to the repetition of the names
of the days of the week, they have a less innocent side
to their characters, for they are forgers of false money,
which they fabricate in the recesses of caverns. We
all recall stories of fairy gold and its perishable nature.
A simple youth sells something on market day to a
fairy, and later on turning over in his pocket the money
he has received he finds that it has been transformed
into beans. The housewife receives gold from a fairy
for services rendered, and carefully places it in a
drawer. A day when she requires it arrives, but, alas!
when she opens the cabinet to take it out she finds
nothing but a small heap of withered leaves. It is such
money that the nains manufacture in their subterranean
mints&mdash;coin which bears the fairy impress of glamourie
for a space, but on later examination proves to be
merely dross.</p>
<p>The nains are also regarded as the originators of a
cabalistic alphabet, the letters of which are engraved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
on several of the megalithic monuments of Morbihan,
and especially those of Gavr&rsquo;inis. He who is able to
decipher this magic script, says tradition, will be able
to tell where hidden treasure is to be found in any part
of the country. Lest any needy folk be of a mind to
fare to Brittany to try their luck in this respect it is
only right to warn them that in all probability they will
find the treasure formula in ogham characters or
serpentine markings, and that as the first has long
ago been deciphered and the second is pure symbolism
they will waste their time and money in any event.</p>
<p>Sorcery hangs about the nain like a garment. Here he
is a prophet and a diviner as well as an enchanter, and
as much of his magic power is employed for ill, small
wonder that the Breton peasant shudders and frowns
when the name of the fearsome tribe is spoken and
gives the dolmens they are supposed to haunt the
widest of wide berths <i>au clair de la lune</i>.</p>
<h3><i>Crions, Courils, and Gorics</i></h3>
<p>Brittany has a species of dwarfs or gnomes peculiar to
itself which in various parts of the country are known
as crions, courils, or gorics. It will at once be seen
how greatly the last word resembles Korrigan, and as
all of them perhaps proceed from a root meaning &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;
the nominal resemblance is not surprising. Like the
nains, these smaller beings inhabit abandoned Druidical
monuments or dwell beneath the foundations of ancient
castles. Carnac is sometimes alluded to in Breton as
&lsquo;Ty C&rsquo;harriquet,&rsquo; &lsquo;the House of the Gorics,&rsquo; the country-folk
in this district holding the belief that its megalithic
monuments were reared by these manikins, whom
they describe as between two and three feet high, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
exceedingly strong, just as the Scottish peasantry speak
of the Picts of folk-lore&mdash;&lsquo;wee fouk but unco&rsquo; strang.&rsquo;
Every night the gorics dance in circles round the stones
of Carnac, and should a mortal interrupt their frolic he
is forced to join in the dance, until, breathless and
exhausted, he falls prone to the earth amid peals of
mocking laughter. Like the nains, the gorics are the
guardians of hidden treasure, for the tale goes that
beneath one of the menhirs of Carnac lies a golden
hoard, and that all the other stones have been set up
the better to conceal it, and so mystify those who would
discover its resting-place. A calculation, the key to
which is to be found in the Tower of London, will alone
indicate the spot where the treasure lies. And here it
may be of interest to state that the ancient national
fortalice of England occurs frequently in Breton and
in Celtic romance.<a name='FNanchor_0037' id='FNanchor_0037'></a><a href='#Footnote_0037' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a> Some of the immigrant Britons
into Armorica probably came from the settlement which
was later to grow into London, and may have carried
tales of its ancient British fortress into their new home.</p>
<p>The courils are peculiar to the ruins of Tresmalouen.
Like the gorics, they are fond of dancing, and they
are quite as malignantly inclined toward the unhappy
stranger who may stumble into their ring. The castle
of Morlaix, too, is haunted by gorics not more than a
foot high, who dwell beneath it in holes in the ground.
They possess treasures as great as those of the gnomes
of Norway or Germany, and these they will sometimes
bestow on lucky mortals, who are permitted, however,
to take but one handful. If a person should attempt to
seize more the whole of the money vanishes, and the
offender&rsquo;s ears are soundly boxed by invisible hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>The night-washers (<i>eur tunnerez noz</i>) are evil spirits
who appear at night on the banks of streams and call
on the passers-by to assist them to wash the linen of the
dead. If they are refused, they seize upon the person
who denies them, drag him into the water, and break
his arms. These beings are obviously the same as the
Bean Nighe, &lsquo;the Washing Woman&rsquo; of the Scottish
Highlands, who is seen in lonely places beside a pool
or stream, washing the linen of those who will shortly
die. In Skye she is said to be short of stature. If
any one catches her she tells all that will befall him in
after life. In Perthshire she is represented as &ldquo;small
and round and dressed in pretty green.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>The Teurst</i></h3>
<p>In the district of Morlaix the peasants are terribly afraid
of beings they call teursts. These are large, black, and
fearsome, like the Highland ourisk, who haunted desert
moors and glens. The <i>teursta poulict</i> appears in the
likeness of some domestic animal. In the district of
Vannes is encountered a colossal spirit called Teus or
Bugelnoz, who appears clothed in white between midnight
and two in the morning. His office is to rescue
victims from the devil, and should he spread his mouth
over them they are secure from the Father of Evil.
The Dusii of Gaul are mentioned by St Augustine, who
regarded them as <i>incubi</i>, and by Isidore of Seville, and
in the name we may perhaps discover the origin of our
expression &lsquo;the deuce!&rsquo;</p>
<h3><i>The Nicole</i></h3>
<p>The Nicole is a spirit of modern creation who torments
the honest fishermen of the Bay of Saint-Brieuc and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Saint-Malo. Just as they are about to draw in their
nets this mischievous spirit leaps around them, freeing
the fish, or he will loosen a boat&rsquo;s anchor so that it will
drift on to a sand-bank. He may divide the cable
which holds the anchor to the vessel and cause endless
trouble. This spirit received its name from an officer
who commanded a battalion of fishermen conscripts,
and who from his intense severity and general reputation
as a martinet obtained a bad reputation among the seafaring
population.</p>
<h3><i>The Mourioche</i></h3>
<p>The Mourioche is a malicious demon of bestial nature,
able, it would seem, to transform himself into any
animal shape he chooses. In general appearance he
is like a year-old foal. He is especially dangerous to
children, and Breton babies are often chided when noisy
or mischievous with the words: &ldquo;Be good, now, the
Mourioche is coming!&rdquo; Of one who appears to have
received a shock, also, it is said: &ldquo;He has seen the
Mourioche.&rdquo; Unlucky is the person who gets in his
way; but doubly so the unfortunate who attempts to
mount him in the belief that he is an ordinary steed,
for after a fiery gallop he will be precipitated into an
abyss and break his neck.</p>
<h3><i>The Ankou</i></h3>
<p>Perhaps there is no spirit of evil which is so much
dreaded by the Breton peasantry as the Ankou, who
travels the duchy in a cart, picking up souls. In the
dead of night a creaking axle-tree can be heard passing
down the silent lanes. It halts at a door; the summons
has been given, a soul quits the doomed house, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
wagon of the Ankou passes on. The Ankou herself&mdash;for
the dread death-spirit of Brittany is probably female&mdash;is
usually represented as a skeleton. M. Anatole
le Braz has elaborated a study of the whole question
in his book on the legend of death in Brittany,<a name='FNanchor_0038' id='FNanchor_0038'></a><a href='#Footnote_0038' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a>
and it is probable that the Ankou is a survival of the
death-goddess of the prehistoric dolmen-builders of
Brittany. MacCulloch<a name='FNanchor_0039' id='FNanchor_0039'></a><a href='#Footnote_0039' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a> considers the Ankou to be a
reminiscence of the Celtic god of death, who watches
over all things beyond the grave and carries off the dead
to his kingdom, but greatly influenced by medieval ideas
of &lsquo;Death the skeleton.&rsquo; In some Breton churches a
little model or statuette of the Ankou is to be seen, and
this is nothing more nor less than a cleverly fashioned
skeleton. The peasant origin of the belief can be found
in the substitution of a cart or wagon for the more
ambitious coach and four of other lands.</p>
<h3><i>The Youdic</i></h3>
<p>Dark and gloomy are many of the Breton legends, of
evil things, gloomy as the depths of the forests in which
doubtless many of them were conceived. Most folk-tales
are tinged with melancholy, and it is rarely in
Breton story that we discover a vein of the joyous.</p>

THE DEMON-DOG<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Among the peaks of the Montagnes d&rsquo;ArrÃ©e lies a vast
and dismal peat bog known as the Yeun, which has
long been regarded by the Breton folk as the portal to
the infernal regions. This Stygian locality has brought
forth many legends. It is, indeed, a remarkable territory.
In summer it seems a vast moor carpeted by
glowing purple heather, which one can traverse up to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
certain point, but woe betide him who would advance
farther, for, surrounded by what seems solid ground,
lies a treacherous quagmire declared by the people
of the neighbourhood to be unfathomable. This part of
the bog, whose victims have been many, is known as
the Youdic. As one leans over it its waters may sometimes
be seen to simmer and boil, and the peasants of
the country-side devoutly believe that when this occurs
infernal forces are working beneath, madly revelling,
and that it is only the near presence of St Michael,
whose mount is hard by, which restrains them from
doing active harm to those who may have to cross the
Yeun.</p>
<p>Countless stories are afloat concerning this weird maelstrom
of mud and bubbling water. At one time it was
the custom to hurl animals suspected of being evil spirits
into its black depths. Malevolent fiends, it was thought,
were wont to materialize in the form of great black dogs,
and unfortunate animals of this type, if they evinced
such peculiarities as were likely to place them under
suspicion, were taken forthwith to the Youdic by a
member of the enlightened priesthood of the district,
and were cast into its seething depths with all the
ceremonies suitable to such an occasion.</p>
<p>A story typical of those told about the place is that of
one Job Ann Drez, who seems to have acted as sexton
and assisted the parish priest in his dealings with the
supernatural. Along with the priest, Job repaired one
evening after sunset to the gloomy waters of the Youdic,
dragging behind him a large black dog of the species
most likely to excite distrust in the priestly mind. The
priest showed considerable anxiety lest the animal should
break loose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If he should get away,&rdquo; he said nervously, &ldquo;both of
us are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wager he does not,&rdquo; replied Job, tying the cord
by which the brute was led securely to his wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, then,&rdquo; said the priest, and he walked boldly
in front, until they came to the foot of the mountain on
the summit of which lies the Youdic.</p>
<p>The priest turned warningly to Job. &ldquo;You must be
circumspect in this place,&rdquo; he said very gravely.
&ldquo;Whatever you may hear, be sure not to turn your
head. Your life in this world and your salvation in the
next depend absolutely on this. You understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A vast desolation surrounded them. So dark was the
night that it seemed to envelop them like a velvet
curtain. Beneath their feet they heard the hissing and
moaning of the bog, awaiting its prey like a restless
and voracious wild beast. Through the dense blackness
they could see the iridescent waters writhing and
gleaming below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Job half to himself, &ldquo;this must be the
gateway to hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word the dog uttered a frightful howl&mdash;such a
howl as froze Job&rsquo;s blood in his veins. It tugged and
strained at the cord which held it with the strength of
a demon, striving to turn on Job and rend him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried the priest in mortal terror, keeping
at a safe distance, however. &ldquo;Hold on, I entreat you,
or else we are undone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Job held on to the demon-dog with all his strength.
Indeed, it was necessary to exert every thew and sinew
if the animal were to be prevented from tearing him to
pieces. Its howls were sufficient to strike terror to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
stoutest heart. &ldquo;Iou! Iou!&rdquo; it yelled again and again.</p>
<p>But Job held on desperately, although the cord cut his
hands and blood ran from the scarified palms. Inch
by inch he dragged the brute toward the Youdic. The
creature in a last desperate effort turned and was about
to spring on him open-mouthed, when all at once the
priest, darting forward, threw his cloak over its head.
It uttered a shriek which sounded through the night
like the cry of a lost soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried the priest. &ldquo;Lie flat on the earth and
put your face on the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the two men done so than a frightful
tumult ensued. First there was the sound of a body
leaping into the morass, then such an uproar as could
only proceed from the mouth of the infernal regions.
Shrieks, cries, hissings, explosions followed in quick
succession for upward of half an hour; then gradually
they died away and a horrible stillness took their place.
The two men rose trembling and unnerved, and slowly
took their way through the darkness, groping and
stumbling until they had left the awful vicinity of the
Yeun behind them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V: WORLD-TALES IN BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">I have</span> entitled this chapter &lsquo;World-Tales&rsquo; to
indicate that the stories it contains are in plot or
<i>motif</i> if not in substance common to the whole
world&mdash;that, in short, although they are found in
Brittany, they are no more Breton than Italian, Russian,
American, or Australian. But although the story which
tells of the search for the golden-haired princess on the
magic horse is the possession of no one particular race,
the tales recounted here have the Breton colouring and
the Breton spirit, and in perusing them we encounter
numerous little allusions to Breton customs or manners
and obtain not a few sidelights upon the Breton character,
its shrewdness and its goodwill, while we may note as
well the narrowness of view and meanness so characteristic
of peoples who have been isolated for a long period
from contact with other races.</p>
<p>The first two of these tales are striking ones built upon
two world-<i>motifs</i>&mdash;those of the magic horse and the
search for the golden-haired princess, who is, of course,
the sun, two themes which have been amalgamated in
not a few deathless stories.</p>
<h3><i>The Youth who did not Know</i></h3>
<p>One day the Marquis of Coat-Squiriou was returning
from Morlaix, when he beheld lying on the road a little
fellow of four or five years of age. He leapt from his
horse, picked the child up, and asked him what he did
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your father?&rdquo; asked the Marquis.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the child for the second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother?&rdquo; asked the kindly nobleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you now, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis told his serving-man to place the child on
the crupper of his horse, as he had taken a fancy to him
and would adopt him. He called him N&rsquo;Oun Doare,
which signifies in Breton, &lsquo;I do not know.&rsquo; He educated
him, and when his schooling was finished took him to
Morlaix, where they put up at the best inn in the town.
The Marquis could not help admiring his adopted son,
who had now grown into a tall, handsome youth, and so
pleased was he with him that he desired to signify his
approval by making him a little present, which he
resolved should take the form of a sword. So they
went out into the town and visited the armourers&rsquo; shops
in search of a suitable weapon. They saw swords of all
kinds, but N&rsquo;Oun Doare would have none of them,
until at last they passed the booth of a seller of scrap-metal,
where hung a rusty old rapier which seemed fit
for nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried N&rsquo;Oun Doare, &ldquo;that is the sword for me.
Please buy it, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see what a condition it is in?&rdquo; said
the Marquis. &ldquo;It is not a fit weapon for a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless it is the only sword I wish for,&rdquo; said
N&rsquo;Oun Doare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you are a strange fellow,&rdquo; said the Marquis,
but he bought the sword nevertheless, and they returned
to Coat-Squiriou. The next day N&rsquo;Oun Doare examined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
his sword and discovered that the blade had the words
&ldquo;I am invincible&rdquo; engraved upon it.</p>
<p>Some time afterward the Marquis said to him: &ldquo;It is
time that you had a horse. Come with me to Morlaix
and we will purchase one.&rdquo; They accordingly set out
for Morlaix. In the market-place they saw many fine
animals, but with none of them was N&rsquo;Oun Doare
content. On returning to the inn, however, he espied
what looked like a broken-down mare standing by the
roadside, and to this sorry beast he immediately drew
the attention of the Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the horse for me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I beg of you,
purchase it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Marquis, &ldquo;that broken-down beast?
Why, only look at it, my son.&rdquo; But N&rsquo;Oun Doare
persisted, and at last, despite his own better judgment,
the Marquis bought the animal. The man who sold it
was a cunning-looking fellow from Cornouaille, who, as
he put the bridle into N&rsquo;Oun Doare&rsquo;s hand, whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the knots on the halter of this animal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied N&rsquo;Oun Doare; &ldquo;what of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, that each time you loosen one the mare will
immediately carry you five hundred leagues from where
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis and his ward returned once more to the
chÃ¢teau, N&rsquo;Oun Doare riding his new purchase, when it
entered into his head to untie one of the knots on the
halter. He did so, and immediately descended in the
middle of Paris&mdash;which we must take the story-teller&rsquo;s
word for it is five hundred leagues from Brittany!</p>
<p>Several months afterward the Marquis had occasion
to go to Paris, and one of the first people he met there
was N&rsquo;Oun Doare, who told him of his adventure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
The Marquis was going to visit the King, and took his
<i>protÃ©gÃ©</i> along with him to the palace, where he was well
received.</p>
<p>Some nights afterward the youth was walking with his
old mare outside the walls of Paris, and noticed something
which glittered very brightly at the foot of an
ancient stone cross which stood where four roads met.
He approached it and beheld a crown of gold, set with
the most brilliant precious stones. He at once picked
it up, when the old mare, turning its head, said to
him: &ldquo;Take care; you will repent this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly surprised, N&rsquo;Oun Doare thought that he had
better replace the crown, but a longing to possess it
overcame him, and although the mare warned him once
more he finally resolved to take it, and, putting it under
his mantle, rode away.</p>
<p>Now the King had confided to his care part of the royal
stables, and when N&rsquo;Oun Doare entered them their
darkness was immediately lit up by the radiance of the
crown which he carried. So well had the Breton lad
attended to the horses under his charge that the other
squires had become jealous, and, observing the strange
light in N&rsquo;Oun Doare&rsquo;s part of the stable, they mentioned
it to the King, who in turn spoke of it to the Marquis of
Coat-Squiriou. The Marquis asked N&rsquo;Oun Doare the
meaning of the light, and the youth replied that it came
from the ancient sword they had bought at Morlaix,
which was an enchanted weapon and shone at intervals
with strange brilliance. But one night his enemies
resolved to examine into the matter more closely, and,
looking through the keyhole of the stable, they saw that
the wondrous light which had so puzzled them shone
from a magnificent crown of gold. They ran at once to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
tell the King, and next night N&rsquo;Oun Doare&rsquo;s stable was
opened with a master-key and the crown removed to the
King&rsquo;s quarters. It was then seen that an inscription
was engraved upon the diadem, but in such strange
characters that no one could read it. The magicians
of the capital were called into consultation, but none of
them could decipher the writing. At last a little boy
of seven years of age was found who said that it was
the crown of the Princess Golden Bell. The King then
called upon N&rsquo;Oun Doare to approach, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not have hidden this thing from me, but
as you are guilty of having done so I doom you to find
the Princess Golden Bell, whom I desire shall become
my wife. If you fail I shall put you to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N&rsquo;Oun Doare left the royal presence in a very perturbed
state of mind. He went to seek his old mare with tears
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the mare, &ldquo;the cause of your sorrow.
You should have left the golden crown alone, as I told
you. But do not repine; go to the King and ask him
for money for your journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad received the money from the King, and set
out on his journey. Arriving at the seashore, one
of the first objects he beheld was a little fish cast
up by the waves on the beach and almost at its last
gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw that fish back into the water,&rdquo; said the mare.
N&rsquo;Oun Doare did so, and the fish, lifting its head from
the water, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved my life, N&rsquo;Oun Doare. I am the
King of the Fishes, and if ever you require my help call
my name by the seashore and I will come.&rdquo; With
these words the Fish-King vanished beneath the water.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>A little later they came upon a bird struggling vainly
to escape from a net in which it was caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the net and set that poor bird free,&rdquo; said the wise
mare.</p>
<p>Upon N&rsquo;Oun Doare doing so the bird paused before
it flew away and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the King of the Birds, N&rsquo;Oun Doare. I will
never forget the service you have rendered me, and if
ever you are in trouble and need my aid you have only
to call me and I shall fly swiftly to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went on their way N&rsquo;Oun Doare&rsquo;s wonderful
mare crossed mountains, forests, vast seas, and streams
with a swiftness and ease that was amazing. Soon they
beheld the walls of the ChÃ¢teau of the Golden Bell rising
before them, and as they drew near they could hear a
most confused and terrible noise coming from it, which
shook N&rsquo;Oun Doare&rsquo;s courage and made him rather
fearful of entering it. Near the door a being of the
most curious aspect was hung to a tree by a chain, and
this peculiar individual had as many horns on his body
as there are days in the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut that unfortunate man down,&rdquo; said the mare.
&ldquo;Will you not give him his freedom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too much afraid to approach him,&rdquo; said N&rsquo;Oun
Doare, alarmed at the man&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fear,&rdquo; said the sagacious animal; &ldquo;he will not
harm you in any manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N&rsquo;Oun Doare did so, and the stranger thanked him most
gratefully, bidding him, as the others whom he had
rescued had done, if he ever required help to call upon
Grifescorne, King of the Demons, for that was his name,
and he would be with him immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter the chÃ¢teau boldly and without fear,&rdquo; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
mare, &ldquo;and I will await you in the wood yonder. After
the Princess Golden Bell has welcomed you she will
show you all the curiosities and marvels of her dwelling.
Tell her you have a horse without an equal, which
can dance most beautifully the dances of every land.
Say that your steed will perform them for her diversion
if she will come and behold it in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything fell out as the mare had said, and the
Princess was delighted and amused by the mare&rsquo;s
dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to mount her,&rdquo; said N&rsquo;Oun Doare, &ldquo;I
vow she would dance even more wonderfully than
before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation did so. In
an instant the adventurous youth was by her side, and
the horse sped through the air, so that in a short space
they found themselves flying over the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have tricked me!&rdquo; cried the infuriated damsel.
&ldquo;But do not imagine that you are at the end of your
troubles; and,&rdquo; she added viciously, &ldquo;you will have
cause to lament more than once ere I wed the old King
of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arrived promptly at Paris, where N&rsquo;Oun Doare
presented the lovely Princess to the monarch, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, I have brought to you the Princess Golden Bell,
whom you desire to make your wife.&rdquo;</p>

N&rsquo;OUN DOARE AND THE PRINCESS GOLDEN BELL<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The King was dazed by the wondrous beauty of the
Princess, and was eager for the marriage to take place
immediately, but this the royal maiden would not hear
of, and declared petulantly that she would not be wed
until she had a ring which she had left behind her at
her chÃ¢teau, in a cabinet of which she had lost the key.</p>
<p>Summoning N&rsquo;Oun Doare, the King charged him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
the task of finding the ring. The unfortunate youth
returned to his wise mare, feeling much cast down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the mare, &ldquo;foolish one! do you not
remember the King of the Birds whom you rescued?
Call upon him, and mayhap he will aid you as he
promised to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a return of hope N&rsquo;Oun Doare did as he was
bid, and immediately the royal bird was with him, and
asked him in what way he could help him. Upon
N&rsquo;Oun Doare explaining his difficulty, the Bird-King
summoned all his subjects, calling each one by name.
They came, but none of them appeared to be small
enough to enter the cabinet by way of the keyhole,
which was the only means of entrance. The wren was
decided to be the only bird with any chance of success,
and he set out for the chÃ¢teau.</p>
<p>Eventually, with much difficulty and the loss of the
greater part of his feathers, the bird procured the ring,
and flew back with it to Paris. N&rsquo;Oun Doare hastened
to present the ring to the Princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fair one,&rdquo; said the impatient King, &ldquo;why delay
our wedding longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said she, pouting discontentedly, &ldquo;there is one
thing that I wish, and without it I will do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you desire? You have only to speak and
it shall be <a name='TC_1'></a><ins title="Added quote">brought.&rdquo;</ins></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, transport my chÃ¢teau with all it contains opposite
to yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the King, aghast. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it is just as impossible that I should marry
you, for without my chÃ¢teau I shall not consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second time the King gave N&rsquo;Oun Doare what
seemed an insurmountable task.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now indeed I am as good as lost!&rdquo; lamented the
youth as they came to the chÃ¢teau and he saw its
massive walls towering above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Grifescorne, King of the Demons, to your assistance,&rdquo;
suggested the wise mare.</p>
<p>With the aid of the Demon-King and his subjects
N&rsquo;Oun Doare&rsquo;s task was again accomplished, and he
and his mare followed the demon army to Paris, where
they arrived as soon as it did.</p>
<p>In the morning the people of Paris were struck dumb
to see a wonderful palace, its golden towers flashing
in the sun, rising opposite to the royal residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be married at last, shall we not?&rdquo; asked
the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Princess, &ldquo;but how shall I enter my
chÃ¢teau and show you its wonders without a key, for
I dropped it in the sea when N&rsquo;Oun Doare and his
horse carried me over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more was the youth charged with the task, and
through the aid of the Fish-King was able to procure
the key, which was cut from a single diamond. None
of the fishes had seen it, but at last the oldest fish,
who had not appeared when his name was pronounced,
came forward and produced it from his mouth.</p>
<p>With a glad heart the successful N&rsquo;Oun Doare returned
to Paris, and as the Princess had now no more excuses
to make the day of the wedding was fixed and the
ceremony was celebrated with much splendour. To the
astonishment of all, when the King and his betrothed
entered the church N&rsquo;Oun Doare followed behind with
his mare. At the conclusion of the ceremony the
mare&rsquo;s skin suddenly fell to the ground, disclosing a
maiden of the most wonderful beauty.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>Smiling upon the bewildered N&rsquo;Oun Doare, the damsel
gave him her hand and said: &ldquo;Come with me to
Tartary, for the king of that land is my father, and
there we shall be wed amid great rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the amazed King and wedding guests, the
pair quitted the church together. More might have
been told of them, but Tartary is a far land and no
news of them has of late years reached Brittany.</p>
<h3><i>The Princess of Tronkolaine</i></h3>
<p>There was once an old charcoal-burner who had twenty-six
grandchildren. For twenty-five of them he had no
great difficulty in procuring godparents, but for the
twenty-sixth&mdash;that, alas! was a different story. Godmothers,
indeed, were to be found in plenty, but he could
not find anyone to act as godfather.</p>
<p>As he wandered disconsolately along the high road,
dwelling on his bad luck, he saw a fine carriage coming
toward him, its occupant no less a personage than the
King himself. The old man made an obeisance so low
that the King was amused, and threw him a handful of
silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here are alms for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied the charcoal-burner, &ldquo;I do not
desire alms. I am unhappy because I cannot find a
godfather for my twenty-sixth grandchild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King considered the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I myself will be godfather to the child,&rdquo; he said at
length. &ldquo;Tell me when it is to be baptized and I will
meet you at the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was delighted beyond measure, and in
due time he and his relatives brought the child to be
baptized. When they reached the church, sure enough,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
there was the King waiting to take part in the ceremony,
and in his honour the child was named Charles. Before
taking leave the King gave to the charcoal-burner the
half of a coin which he had broken in two. This
Charles on reaching his eighteenth birthday was to
convey to the Court at Paris, as a token whereby his
godfather should know him. His Majesty also left a
thousand crowns, which were to be utilized in the
education and general upbringing of the child.</p>
<p>Time passed and Charles attained his eighteenth birthday.
Taking the King&rsquo;s token, he set out for the royal
abode. As he went he encountered an old man, who
warned him on no account to drink from a certain well
which he would pass on his way. The lad promised to
regard the warning, but ere he reached the well he had
forgotten it.</p>
<p>A man sat by the side of the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hot and tired,&rdquo; he said, feigning courtesy,
&ldquo;will you not stop to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was cool and inviting. Charles bent his head
and drank thirstily. And while he drank the stranger
robbed him of his token; but this he did not know till
afterward.</p>
<p>Gaily Charles resumed his way, while the thief went to
Paris by a quicker route and got there before him.</p>
<p>Boldly the thief demanded audience of the King, and
produced the token so wickedly come by. The sovereign
ordered the other half of the coin to be brought out,
and lo! they fitted exactly. And because the thief had
a plausible face the good King did not doubt that he
was indeed his godson. He therefore had him treated
with all honour and respect, and bestowed gifts upon
him lavishly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>Meanwhile Charles had arrived in Paris, and, finding
that he had been deprived of his only means of proving
his identity to the King, he accepted the situation
philosophically and set about earning his living. He
succeeded in obtaining a post as herdsman on the royal
estates.</p>
<p>One day the robber was greatly disconcerted to find the
real Charles at the very gates of the palace. He determined
to be rid of him once for all, so he straightway
approached the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, there is a man among your retainers
who has said that he will demand of the sun why it is so
red at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is indeed a foolish fellow,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Our
decree is that he shall carry out his rash boast to-morrow
ere sunset, or, if it be but idle folly, lose his head on
the following morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief was delighted with the success of his plot.
Poor Charles was summoned before the King and bidden
to ask the sun why he was so red at sunrise. In vain he
denied having uttered the speech. Had not the King
the word of his godson?</p>
<p>Next morning Charles set out on his journey. Ere he
had gone very far he met an old man who asked him his
errand, and afterward gave him a wooden horse on
which to ride to the sun. Charles thought this but a
sorry joke. However, no sooner had he mounted his
wooden steed than it rose into the air and flew with him
to where the sun&rsquo;s castle towered on the peak of a lofty
mountain.</p>
<p>To the sun, a resplendent warrior, Charles addressed
his query.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; said the sun, &ldquo;I pass the castle of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Princess of Tronkolaine, and she is so lovely that I must
needs look my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles, mounted on his wooden horse, flew with this
answer to Paris. The King was satisfied, but the thief
gnashed his teeth in secret rage, and plotted yet further
against the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this herdsman who tends
your herds has said that he will lead hither the Princess
of Tronkolaine to be your bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has said so,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;he shall lead her
hither or forfeit his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought Charles, when he learned of the plot,
&ldquo;I must bid farewell to my life&mdash;there is no hope
for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same he set out boldly enough, and by and by
encountered the old man who had helped him on his
previous mission. To him Charles confided his troubles,
begging for advice and assistance.</p>
<p>The old man pondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return to the Court,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and ask the King to
give you three ships, one laden with oatmeal, another
with bacon, and the third with salt meat. Then sail on
till you come to an island covered with ants. To their
monarch, the Ant-King, make a present of the cargo of
oatmeal. He will direct you to a second island, whereon
dwell fierce lions. Fear them not. Present your cargo
of bacon to their King and he will become your friend.
Yet a third island you will touch, inhabited only by
sparrow-hawks. Give to their King your cargo of
salt meat and he will show you the abode of the
Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles thanked the sage for his advice, which he
promptly proceeded to follow. The King granted him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
the three ships, and he sailed away in search of the
Princess.</p>
<p>When he came to the first island, which was swarming
with ants, he gave up his cargo of grain, and so won
the friendship of the little creatures. At the second
island he unloaded the bacon, which he presented to
the King of the Lions; while at the third he gave up
the salt beef to the King of the Sparrow-hawks, who
directed him how to come at the object of his quest.
Each monarch bade Charles summon him instantly if
he had need of assistance.</p>
<p>Setting sail from the island of the sparrow-hawks, the
youth arrived at length at the abode of the Princess.</p>
<p>She was seated under an orange-tree, and as Charles
gazed upon her he thought her the most beautiful
woman in the world, as indeed she was.</p>
<p>The Princess, looking up, beheld a comely youth,
beneath whose ardent gaze her eyes fell. Smiling
graciously, she invited him into her castle, and he,
nothing loath, followed her into the great hall, where
tempting viands were spread before him.</p>
<p>When he had supped he made known his errand to the
Princess, and begged her to accompany him to Paris.
She agreed only on condition that he would perform
three tasks set him, and when Charles was curious to
know what was required of him she led him into another
room where was a large heap of every kind of seed&mdash;corn,
barley, clover, flax&mdash;all mixed up anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first task,&rdquo; said the Princess: &ldquo;you must
put each kind of seed into a different heap, so that no
single seed shall be out of its place. This you must
accomplish ere to-morrow at sunrise.&rdquo; With that she
left the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>Charles was in despair, until he bethought him of his
friend the King of the Ants, whom he begged to help
him. Scarcely had he uttered the words when ants
began to fill the room, coming from he knew not where.
In less time than it takes to tell they had arranged the
seeds into separate heaps, so that no single seed was
out of its place.</p>
<p>When the Princess arrived in the morning she was
astonished to find the hero fast asleep and the work
accomplished. All day she entertained him hospitably
in her castle, and at nightfall she showed him the second
task. An avenue of great oaks led down from the
castle. Giving him a wooden axe and a wooden saw,
the Princess bade him cut down all the trees ere
morning.</p>
<p>When she had left him Charles called upon the King
of the Lions. Instantly a number of lions bounded upon
the scene, and with teeth and claws soon performed
the task.</p>
<p>In the morning the Princess, finding Charles asleep and
all the trees cut down, was more astonished than ever.</p>
<p>The third task was the most difficult of all. A high
mountain had to be levelled to the plain in a single
night. Without the help of the sparrow-hawks, Charles
would certainly have failed, but these faithful creatures
worked with a will, and soon had the great mountain
carried away piece by piece and dropped into the sea.</p>
<p>When the Princess came for the third time and found
the hero asleep by the finished task she fell in love with
him straightway, and kissed him softly on the brow.</p>
<p>There was now nothing further to hinder his return,
and he begged the Princess to accompany him to Paris.
In due time they arrived in that city, to be welcomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
with great warmth by the people. The beauty of the
lady won all hearts. But great was the general
astonishment when she declared that she would marry,
not the King, but the youth who had brought her to
Paris! Charles thereupon declared himself the true
godson of the King, and the monarch, far from being
angry, gave the couple his blessing and great estates;
and when in course of time he died they reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>As for the thief, he was ordered to execution forthwith,
and was roasted to death in a large oven.</p>
<h3><i>The Princess Starbright</i></h3>
<p>This is another tale which introduces the search for the
sun-princess in a peculiar setting.</p>
<p>In the long ago there lived near the Lake of LÃ©guer
a jolly miller who found recreation after his work in
shooting the wild swans and ducks which frequented
that stretch of water. One December day, when it was
freezing hard and the earth was covered with snow, he
observed a solitary duck near the edge of the lake.
He shot at it, and went forward to pick it up, when he
saw to his amazement that it had changed into a beautiful
princess. He was ready to drop into the snow with
fright, but the lady came graciously forward to him,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not, my brave fellow, for know that I have
been enchanted these many years under the form of
a wild duck, because of the enmity of three malicious
demons. You can restore me permanently to my
human shape if you choose to show only a <a name='TC_2'></a><ins title="Was 'litle'">little</ins> perseverance
and courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you desire me to do, madam?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
stammered the miller, abashed by the lady&rsquo;s beauty
and condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What only a brave man could accomplish, my friend,&rdquo;
she replied; &ldquo;all that you have to do is to pass three
consecutive nights in the old manor which you can see
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller shuddered, for he had heard the most terrible
stories in connexion with the ruined manor, which had
an evil name in the district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whom might I not encounter
there! Even the devil himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said the Princess, sadly, &ldquo;if you do
as I ask you will have to encounter not one but a dozen
devils, who will torment you in every possible way.
But fear nothing, for I can provide you with a magic
ointment which will preserve you entirely from all the
injuries they would attempt to inflict upon you. Even
if you were dead I could resuscitate you. I assure you
that if you will do as I ask you will never regret it.
Beneath the hearthstone in the hall of the manor are
three casks of gold and three of silver, and all these will
belong to you and to me if you assist me; so put your
courage to the proof, I pray you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller squared his shoulders. &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
will obey you, even if I have to face a hundred devils
instead of twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess smiled encouragingly and disappeared.
On the following night the miller set out for the old
manor, carrying a bundle of faggots to make a fire, and
some cider and tobacco to refresh him during his vigil.
When he arrived in the dismal old place he sat himself
down by the hearth, where he had built a good fire, and
lit his pipe. But he had scarcely done so when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
heard a most tremendous commotion in the chimney.
Somewhat scared, he hid himself under an old bed
which stood opposite the hearth, and, gazing anxiously
from his place of concealment, beheld eleven grisly
fiends descend from the flue. They seemed astonished
to find a fire on the hearth, and did not appear to be in
the best of tempers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Boiteux?&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; growled
another, who appeared to be the chief of the band, &ldquo;he
is always late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, behold him,&rdquo; said a third, as Boiteux arrived by
the same road as his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, comrades,&rdquo; cried Boiteux, &ldquo;have you heard the
news?&rdquo; The others shrugged their shoulders and shook
their heads sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Boiteux, &ldquo;I am convinced that the miller
of LÃ©guer is here, and that he is trying to free the
Princess from the enchantment which we have placed
upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hurried search at once took place, the demons
scrambling from one part of the room to the other,
tearing down the curtains and making every effort to
discover the hiding-place of the intruder. At last
Boiteux, peering under the bed, saw the miller crouching
there, and cried out: &ldquo;Here is the rogue beneath
the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unlucky miller was then seized by the foot and
dragged into the shrieking and leaping circle. With
a gesture of command the chief demon subdued the
antics of his followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, my jolly miller,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our friend the Princess
has found a champion in you, has she? Well, we are
going to have some sport with you, which I fear will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
not be quite to your taste, but I can assure you that
you will not again have the opportunity of assisting a
princess in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he seized the miller and thrust him from him
with great force. As he flew like a stone from a sling,
another of the fiends seized him, and the unhappy
man was thrown violently about from one to the other.
At last they threw him out of the window into the courtyard,
and as he did not move they thought that he was
dead. But in the midst of their laughter and rejoicing
at the easy manner in which they had got rid of him,
cockcrow sounded, and the diabolic company swiftly
disappeared. They had scarcely taken their departure
when the Princess arrived. She tenderly anointed the
miller&rsquo;s hurts from the little pot of magic ointment she
had brought with her, and, nothing daunted, now that
he was thoroughly revived, the bold fellow announced
his intention of seeing the matter through and remaining
in the manor for the two following nights.</p>
<p>He had scarcely ensconced himself in his seat by the
chimney-side on the second night when the twelve fiends
came tumbling down the chimney as before. At one
end of the room was a large heap of wood, behind which
the miller quickly took refuge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell the smell of a Christian!&rdquo; cried Boiteux. A
search followed, and once more the adventurous miller
was dragged forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; cried the leader, &ldquo;so you are not dead after
all! Well, I can assure you that we shall not botch our
work on this occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the grisly company placed a large cauldron of
oil upon the fire, and when this was boiling they seized
their victim and thrust him into it. The most dreadful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
agony seized the miller as the liquid seethed around his
body, and he was just about to faint under the intensity
of the torture when once again the cock crew and the
fiendish band took themselves off. The Princess
quickly appeared, and, drawing the miller from the
cauldron, smeared him from head to foot with the
ointment.</p>
<p>On the third night the devils once more found the miller
in the apartment. In dismay Boiteux suggested that
he should be roasted on a spit and eaten, but unluckily
for them they took a long time to come to this conclusion,
and when they were about to impale their
victim on the spit, the cock crew and they were forced
to withdraw, howling in baffled rage. The Princess
arrived as before, and was delighted to see that this time
her champion did not require any assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is well now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have freed me from
my enchantment and the treasure is ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They raised the hearthstone from its place, and, as she
had said, the three casks of gold and the three casks of
silver were found resting beneath it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take what you wish for yourself,&rdquo; said the Princess.
&ldquo;As for me, I cannot stay here; I must at once make
a journey which will last a year and a day, after which
we shall never part again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words she disappeared. The miller was
grieved at her departure, but, consoling himself with
the treasure, made over his mill to his apprentice and,
apprising one of his companions of his good luck,
resolved to go upon a journey with him, until such time
as the Princess should return. He visited the neighbouring
countries, and, with plenty of money at his
disposal, found existence very pleasant indeed. After
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
some eight months of this kind of life, he and his friend
resolved to return to Brittany, and set out on their
journey. One day they encountered on the road an old
woman selling apples. She asked them to buy, but the
miller was advised by his friend not to pay any heed to
her. Ignoring the well-meant advice, the miller laughed
and bought three apples. He had scarcely eaten one
when he became unwell. Recalling how the fruit had
disagreed with him, he did not touch the other apples
until the day on which the Princess had declared she
would return. When on the way to the manor to meet
her, he ate the second apple. He began to feel sleepy,
and, lying down at the foot of a tree, fell into a deep
slumber.</p>
<p>Soon after the Princess arrived in a beautiful star-coloured
chariot drawn by ten horses. When she saw
the miller lying sleeping she inquired of his friend what
had chanced to him. The man acquainted her with the
adventure of the apples, and the Princess told him that
the old woman from whom he had purchased them was
a sorceress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am unable to take him with me
in this condition, but I will come to this place to-morrow
and again on the following day, and if he be awake I
will transport him hence in my chariot. Here are a
golden pear and a handkerchief; give him these and tell
him that I will come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disappeared in her star-coloured equipage. Shortly
afterward the miller wakened, and his friend told him
what had occurred and gave him the pear and the
kerchief. The next day the friends once more repaired
to the spot where the Princess had vanished, but in
thoughtlessness the miller had eaten of the third apple,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
and once more the Princess found him asleep. In
sorrow she promised to return next day for the last time,
once more leaving a golden pear and a handkerchief
with his friend, to whom she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is not awake when I come to-morrow he will
have to cross three powers and three seas in order to
find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unluckily, however, the miller was still asleep when
the Princess appeared on the following day. She
repeated what she had said to his friend concerning the
ordeal that the unfortunate miller would have to face
before he might see her again, and ere she took her
departure left a third pear and a third handkerchief
behind her. When the miller awoke and found that she
had gone he went nearly crazy with grief, but nevertheless
he declared his unalterable intention of regaining the
Princess, even if he should have to travel to the ends of
the earth in search of her. Accordingly he set out to
find her abode. He walked and walked innumerable
miles, until at last he came to a great forest. As he
arrived at its gloomy borders night fell, and he considered
it safest to climb a tree, from which, to his great
satisfaction, he beheld a light shining in the distance.
Descending, he walked in the direction of the light, and
found a tiny hut made of the branches of trees, in which
sat a little old man with a long white beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, grandfather,&rdquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, my child,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;I
behold you with pleasure, for it is eighty years since I
have seen any human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller entered the hut and sat down beside the old
man, and after some conversation told him the object
of his journey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I will help you, my son,&rdquo; said the ancient. &ldquo;Do you
see these enchanted gaiters? Well, I wore them at your
age. When you buckle them over your legs you will
be able to travel seven leagues at a single step, and you
will arrive without any difficulty at the castle of the
Princess you desire so much to see again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller passed the night in the hut with the old
hermit, and on the following morning, with the rising
of the sun, buckled on the magic gaiters and stepped
out briskly. All went well to begin with, nothing
arrested his progress, and he sped over rivers, forests,
and mountains. As the sun was setting he came to the
borders of a second forest, where he observed a second
hut, precisely similar to that in which he had passed
the previous night. Going toward it, he found it
occupied by an aged woman, of whom he demanded
supper and lodging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my son,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;you do ill to
come here, for I have three sons, terrible fellows, who
will be here presently, and I am certain that if you
remain they will devour you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller asked the names of the sons, and was
informed by the old woman that they were January,
February, and March. From this he concluded that
the crone he was addressing was none other than the
mother of the winds, and on asking her if this was so
she admitted that he had judged correctly. While they
were talking there was a terrible commotion in the
chimney, from which descended an enormous giant with
white hair and beard, breathing out clouds of frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I see, mother, that you have not
neglected to provide for my supper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softly, softly, good son,&rdquo; said the old dame; &ldquo;this is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
little Yves, my nephew and your cousin; you must not
eat him.&rdquo; The giant, who seemed greatly annoyed,
retired into a corner, growling. Shortly afterward his
brothers, February and March, arrived, and were
told the same tale regarding the miller&rsquo;s relationship
to them.</p>
<p>Our hero, resolved to profit by the acquaintanceship,
asked the gigantic February if he would carry him to
the palace of the Princess, whom he described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said February, &ldquo;without doubt you speak of the
Princess Starbright. If you wish I will give you a lift
on my back part of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller gratefully accepted the offer, and in the
morning mounted on the back of the mighty wind-giant,
who carried him over a great sea. Then, after
traversing much land and a second ocean, and while
crossing a third spacious water, February expressed
himself as quite fatigued and said that he could not
carry his new cousin any farther. The miller glanced
beneath him at the great waste of waters and begged
him to make an effort to reach the land on the other
side. Giving vent to a deep-throated grumble, February
obeyed, and at last set him down outside the walls of
the town where the castle of the Princess Starbright was
situated. The miller entered the town and came to an
inn, and, having dined, entered into conversation with
the hostess, asking her the news of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the woman, amazed, &ldquo;where do you come
from that you don&rsquo;t know that the Princess Starbright
is to be married to-day, and to a husband that she does
not love? The wedding procession will pass the door
in a few moments on its way to the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller was greatly downcast at these words, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
plucking up courage he placed on a little table before
the inn the first of the pears and handkerchiefs that the
Princess had left with his friend. Shortly afterward
the wedding procession passed, and the Princess
immediately remarked the pear and the kerchief, and
also recognized the miller standing close by. She
halted, and, feigning illness, begged that the ceremony
might be postponed until the morrow. Having returned
to the palace, she sent one of her women to
purchase the fruit and the handkerchief, and these
the miller gave the maiden without question. On the
following day the same thing happened, and on the
third occasion of the Princess&rsquo;s passing the same series
of events occurred. This time the Princess sent for
the miller, and the pair embraced tenderly and wept
with joy at having recovered each other.</p>
<p>Now the Princess was as clever as she was beautiful,
and she had a stratagem by which she hoped to marry
the miller without undue opposition on the part of her
friends. So she procured the marriage garments of the
prince, her <i>fiancÃ©</i>, and attiring the miller in them, took
him to the marriage feast, which had been prepared for
the fourth time at a late hour; but she hid her lover in
a secluded corner from the public gaze. After a while
she pretended to be looking for something, and upon
being asked what she had lost, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a beautiful coffer, but, alas! I have lost the
key of it. I have found a new key, but it does not fit
the casket; should I not search until I have recovered
the old one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt!&rdquo; cried every one. Then the Princess,
going to the place where the miller was concealed, led
him forth by the hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My lords and gentles,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the coffer I spoke
of is my heart; here is the one key that can fit it, the
key that I had lost and have found again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess and the miller were married amid universal
rejoicings; and some time after the ceremony they did
not fail to revisit the Lake of LÃ©guer, the scene of their
first meeting, the legend of which still clings like the
mists of evening to its shores.</p>
<p>This quaint and curious tale, in which the native folk-lore
and French elements are so strangely mingled,
deals, like its predecessor, with the theme of the search
for the fairy princess. We turn now to another tale of
quest with somewhat similar incidents, where the solar
nature of one of the characters is perhaps more obvious&mdash;the
quest for the mortal maiden who has been carried
off by the sun-hero. We refrain in this place from
indicating the mythological basis which underlies such
a tale as this, as such a phenomenon is already amply
illustrated in other works in this series.</p>
<h3><i>The Castle of the Sun</i></h3>
<p>There once lived a peasant who had seven children, six
of them boys and the seventh a girl. They were very
poor and all had to work hard for a living, but the
drudges of the family were the youngest son, Yvon,
and his sister, Yvonne. Because they were gentler and
more delicate than the others, they were looked upon
as poor, witless creatures, and all the hardest work was
given them to do. But the children comforted each
other, and became but the better favoured as they
grew up.</p>
<p>One day when Yvonne was taking the cattle to pasture
she encountered a handsome youth, so splendidly garbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
that her simple heart was filled with awe and admiration.
To her astonishment he addressed her and courteously
begged her hand in marriage. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I shall meet you here at this hour, and you shall give
me an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Troubled, yet secretly happy, Yvonne made her way
home, and told her parents all that had chanced. At
first they laughed her to scorn, and refused to believe
her story of the handsome prince, but when at length
they were convinced they told her she was free to marry
whom she would.</p>
<p>On the following day Yvonne betook herself to the
trysting-place, where her lover awaited her, even more
gloriously resplendent than on the occasion of his first
coming. The very trappings of his horse were of
gleaming gold. At Yvonne&rsquo;s request he accompanied
her to her home, and made arrangements with her
kindred for the marriage. To all inquiries regarding
his name and place of abode he returned that these
should be made known on the wedding morning.</p>
<p>Time passed, and on the day appointed the glittering
stranger came to claim his wife. The ceremony over,
he swept her into a carriage and was about to drive
away, when her brothers reminded him of his promise
to reveal his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where must we go to visit our sister?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eastward,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to a palace built of crystal,
beyond the Sea of Darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the pair were gone.</p>
<p>A year elapsed, and the brothers neither saw nor heard
anything of their sister, so that at length they decided
to go in search of her. Yvon would have accompanied
them, but they bade him stay at home.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are so stupid,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you would be of no use
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eastward they rode, and ever eastward, till at length
they found themselves in the heart of a great forest.
Then night came on and they lost the path. Twice
a great noise, like the riot of a tempest, swept over
their heads, leaving them trembling and stricken with
panic.</p>
<p>By and by they came upon an old woman tending a
great fire, and of her they inquired how they might
reach the abode of their brother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;but my son may
be able to direct you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the third time they heard the noise as of a great
wind racing over the tree-tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;it is my son approaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a huge giant, this son of hers, and when he
drew near the fire he said loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh ho! I smell the blood of a Christian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried his mother sharply. &ldquo;Would you eat
your pretty cousins, who have come so far to visit us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the giant became quite friendly toward his
&lsquo;cousins,&rsquo; and when he learned of their mission even
offered to conduct them part of the way.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his amiability, however, the brothers
spent an anxious night, and were up betimes on the
following morning.</p>
<p>The giant made ready for departure. First of all he
bade the old woman pile fresh fuel on the fire. Then
he spread a great black cloth, on which he made the
brothers stand. Finally he strode into the fire, and
when his clothes were consumed the black cloth rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
into the air, bearing the brothers with it. Its going was
marked by the sound of rushing wind which had terrified
them on the preceding day. At length they alighted on
a vast plain, half of which was rich and fertile, while the
other half was bleak and arid as a desert. The plain
was dotted with horses, and, curiously enough, those on
the arid side were in splendid condition, whereas those
on the fertile part were thin and miserable.</p>
<p>The brothers had not the faintest idea of which direction
they ought to take, and after a vain attempt to mount
the horses on the plain they decided to return home.
After many wanderings they arrived at their native
place once more.</p>
<p>When Yvon learned of the ill-success which had attended
their mission he decided to go himself in search of his
sister, and though his brothers laughed at him they gave
him an old horse and bade him go.</p>
<p>Eastward and eastward he rode, till at length he reached
the forest where the old woman still tended the fire.
Seeing that he was strong and fearless, she directed
him by a difficult and dangerous road, which, however,
he must pursue if he wished to see his sister.</p>
<p>It was indeed a place of terrors. Poisonous serpents
lay across his track; ugly thorns and briers sprang
underfoot; at one point a lake barred his way.</p>
<p>Finally a subterranean passage led him into his sister&rsquo;s
country, where everything was of crystal, shining with
the splendour of the sun itself. At the end of a gleaming
pathway rose a castle built entirely of crystal, its
innumerable domes and turrets reflecting the light in
a thousand prismatic hues.</p>
<p>Having gained access to the castle through a cave,
Yvon wandered through its many beautiful chambers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
till in one of these he came upon his sister asleep on
a silken couch.</p>
<p>Entranced with her beauty, and not daring to wake
her, he slipped behind a curtain and watched her in
silence; but as time went on he marvelled that she
did not wake.</p>
<p>At eventide a handsome youth&mdash;Yvon&rsquo;s brother-in-law&mdash;entered
the chamber, struck Yvonne sharply three times,
then flung himself down by her side and went to sleep.
All night Yvon waited in his place of concealment. In
the morning the young man rose from his couch, gave
his wife three resounding blows, and went away. Only
then did Yvon emerge and wake his sister.</p>
<p>Brother and sister exchanged a tender greeting, and
found much to talk of after their long separation. Yvon
learned that the country to which he had come was
a peculiar place, where meat and drink could be entirely
dispensed with, while even sleep was not a necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Yvonne,&rdquo; he said, remembering what he had
seen of his brother-in-law, &ldquo;does your husband treat
you well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yvonne assured him that her husband was all she could
wish&mdash;that she was perfectly happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he always absent during the day?&rdquo; he asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where he goes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a mind,&rdquo; said Yvon, &ldquo;to ask him to let me
accompany him on his journey. What say you, sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very good plan,&rdquo; said Yvonne.</p>
<p>At sundown her husband returned home. He and
Yvon became very good friends, and the latter begged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
to be allowed to accompany him on his journey the
following day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do so,&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;but only on
one condition: if you touch or address anyone save
me you must return home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yvon readily agreed to accept the condition, and early
next morning the two set off. Ere long they came
to a wide plain, one half of which was green and fruitful,
while the other half was barren and dry. On this
plain cattle were feeding, and those on the arid part
were fat and well-conditioned, while the others were
mean and shrivelled to a degree. Yvon learned from
his companion that the fat cattle represented those
who were contented with their meagre lot, while the
lean animals were those who, with a plentiful supply of
worldly goods, were yet miserable and discontented.</p>
<p>Many other strange things they saw as they went, but
that which seemed strangest of all to Yvon was the
sight of two trees lashing each other angrily with their
branches, as though each would beat the other to the
ground.</p>
<p>Laying his hands on them, he forbade them to fight,
and lo! in a moment they became two human beings,
a man and wife, who thanked Yvon for releasing them
from an enchantment under which they had been laid
as a punishment for their perpetual bickering.</p>
<p>Anon they reached a great cavern from which weird
noises proceeded, and Yvon would fain have advanced
farther; but his companion forbade him, reminding him
that in disenchanting the trees he had failed to observe
the one essential condition, and must return to the
palace where his sister dwelt.</p>
<p>There Yvon remained for a few days longer, after which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
his brother-in-law directed him by a speedy route to
his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;but ere long you will return,
and then it will be to remain with us for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reaching his native village Yvon found all trace
of his dwelling gone. Greatly bewildered, he inquired
for his father by name. An old greybeard replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He lived in the
days when my grandfather&rsquo;s grandfather was but a boy,
and now he sleeps in the churchyard yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only then did Yvon realize that his visit to his sister
had been one, not of days, but of generations!</p>
<h3><i>The Seigneur with the Horse&rsquo;s Head</i></h3>
<p>Famous among all peoples is the tale of the husband
surrounded by mystery&mdash;bespelled in animal form, like
the Prince in the story of Beauty and the Beast,
nameless, as in that of Lohengrin, or unbeheld of his
spouse, as in the myth of Cupid and Psyche. Among
uncivilized peoples it is frequently forbidden to the wife
to see her husband&rsquo;s face until some time after marriage,
and the belief that ill-luck will befall one or both
should this law be disregarded runs through primitive
story, being perhaps reminiscent of a time when the
man of an alien or unfriendly tribe crept to his wife&rsquo;s
lodge or hut under cover of darkness and returned ere
yet the first glimmer of dawn might betray him to the men
of her people. The story which follows, however, deals
with the theme of the enchanted husband whose wife must
not speak to anyone until her first child receives the sacrament
of baptism, and is, perhaps, unique of its kind.</p>
<p>There lived at one time in the old chÃ¢teau of Kerouez,
in the commune of Loguivy-Plougras, a rich and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
powerful seigneur, whose only sorrow was the dreadful
deformity of his son, who had come into the world with
a horse&rsquo;s head. He was naturally kept out of sight as
much as possible, but when he had attained the age
of eighteen years he told his mother one day that he
desired to marry, and requested her to interview a
farmer in the vicinity who had three pretty young
daughters, in order that she might arrange a match
with one of them.</p>
<p>The good lady did as she was requested, not without
much embarrassment and many qualms of conscience,
and after conversing upon every imaginable subject,
at length gently broke the object of her visit to the
astonished farmer. The poor man was at first horrified,
but little by little the lady worked him into a good
humour, so that at last he consented to ask his daughters
if any one of them would agree to marry the afflicted
young lord. The two elder girls indignantly refused
the offer, but when it was made plain to them that
she who espoused the seigneur would one day be
chÃ¢telaine of the castle and become a fine lady, the
eldest daughter somewhat reluctantly consented and
the match was agreed upon.</p>
<p>Some days afterward the bride-to-be happened to pass
the castle and saw the servants washing the linen, when
one cried to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world can a fine girl like you be such a fool
as to throw herself away on a man with a horse&rsquo;s head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he is rich, and, let me tell you,
we won&rsquo;t be married for long, for on the bridal night
I shall cut his throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment a gay cavalier passed and smiled
at the farmer&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are having a strange conversation, mademoiselle,&rdquo;
he said. She coloured and looked somewhat confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;it is hateful to be mocked by
these wenches because I have the bad luck to be
espoused to a seigneur with a horse&rsquo;s head, and I assure
you I feel so angry that I shall certainly carry out my
threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unknown laughed shortly and went his way. In
time the night of the nuptials arrived. A grand <i>fÃªte</i>
was held at the chÃ¢teau, and, the ceremony over, the
bridesmaids conducted the young wife to her chamber.
The bridegroom shortly followed, and to the surprise of
his wife, no sooner had the hour of sunset come than
his horse&rsquo;s head disappeared and he became exactly as
other men. Approaching the bed where his bride lay,
he suddenly seized her, and before she could cry out or
make the least clamour he killed her in the manner in
which she had threatened to kill him.</p>
<p>In the morning his mother came to the chamber, and
was horrified at the spectacle she saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious heavens! my son, what have you done?&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done that, my mother,&rdquo; replied her son, &ldquo;which
was about to be done to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three months afterward the young seigneur asked his
mother to repair once more to the farmer with the
request that another of his daughters might be given
him in marriage. The second daughter, ignorant of
the manner of her sister&rsquo;s death, and mindful of the
splendid wedding festivities, embraced the proposal
with alacrity. Like her sister, she chanced to be
passing the washing-green of the castle one day, and
the laundresses, knowing of her espousal, taunted her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
upon it, so that at last she grew very angry and
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be troubled long with the animal, I can assure
you, for on the very night that I wed him I shall kill
him like a pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that very moment the same unknown gentleman
who had overheard the fatal words of her sister passed,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, young women, that&rsquo;s very strange talk of
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, monseigneur,&rdquo; stammered the betrothed girl,
&ldquo;they are twitting me upon marrying a man with a
horse&rsquo;s head; but I will cut his throat on the night
of our wedding with as little conscience as I would cut
the throat of a pig.&rdquo; The unknown gentleman laughed
as he had done before and passed upon his way.</p>
<p>As on the previous occasion, the wedding was celebrated
with all the pomp and circumstance which usually
attends a Breton ceremony of the kind, and in due time
the bride was conducted to her chamber, only to be
found in the morning weltering in her blood.</p>
<p>At the end of another three months the seigneur dispatched
his mother for the third time to the farmer, with
the request that his younger daughter might be given
him in marriage, but on this occasion her parents were
by no means enraptured with the proposal. When
the great lady, however, promised them that if they
consented to the match they would be given the
farm to have and to hold as their own property, they
found the argument irresistible and reluctantly agreed.
Strange to say, the girl herself was perfectly composed
about the matter, and gave it as her opinion that if her
sisters had met with a violent death they were entirely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
to blame themselves, for some reason which she could
not explain, and she added that she thought that their
loose and undisciplined way of talking had had much
to do with their untimely fate. Just as her sisters had
been, she too was taunted by the laundresses regarding
her choice of a husband, but her answer to them was
very different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they met with their deaths,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was
because of their wicked utterances. I do not in the
least fear that I shall have the same fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As before the unknown seigneur passed, but this time,
without saying anything, he hurried on his way and was
soon lost to view.</p>
<p>The wedding of the youngest sister was even more
splendid than that of the two previous brides. On the
following morning the young seigneur&rsquo;s mother hastened
with fear and trembling to the marriage chamber, and
to her intense relief found that her daughter-in-law was
alive. For some months the bride lived happily with
her husband, who every night at set of sun regained his
natural appearance as a young and handsome man. In
due time a son was born to them, who had not the least
sign of his semi-equine parentage, and when they were
about to have the infant baptized the father said to the
young mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken to what I have to say. I was condemned to
suffer the horrible enchantment you know of until such
time as a child should be born to me, and I shall be
immediately delivered from the curse whenever this
infant is baptized. But take care that you do not speak
a word until the baptismal bells cease to sound, for if
you utter a syllable, even to your mother, I shall disappear
on the instant and you will never see me more.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>Full of the resolve not to utter a single sound, the young
mother, who lay in bed, kept silent, until at last she
heard the sound of bells, when, in her joy, forgetting
the warning, she turned to her mother, who sat near,
with words of congratulation on her lips. A few
moments afterward her husband rushed into the room,
the horse&rsquo;s head still upon his shoulders. He was
covered with sweat, and panted fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, miserable woman,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what have you done?
I must leave you, and you shall never see me more!&rdquo;
and he made as if to quit the room. His wife rose from
her bed, and strove to detain him, but he struck at her
with his fist. The blood trickled out and made three
spots on his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold these spots,&rdquo; cried the young wife; &ldquo;they
shall never disappear until I find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I swear to you,&rdquo; cried her husband, &ldquo;that you
will never find me until you have worn out three pairs
of iron shoes in doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he ran off at such speed that the
poor wife could not follow him, and, fainting, she sank
to the ground.</p>
<p>Some time after her husband had left her the young
wife had three pairs of iron shoes made and went in
search of him. After she had travelled about the world
for nearly ten years the last pair of shoes began to show
signs of wear, when she found herself one day at a castle
where the servants were hanging out the clothes to dry,
and she heard one of the laundresses say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see this shirt? I declare it is enchanted, for
although I have washed it again and again I cannot rub
out these three spots of blood which you see upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the wanderer heard this she approached the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
laundress and said to her: &ldquo;Let me try, I pray you. I
think I can wash the shirt clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gave her the shirt, she washed it, and the spots
disappeared. So grateful was the laundress that she
bade the stranger go to the castle and ask for a meal and
a bed. These were willingly granted her, and at night
she was placed in a small apartment next to that occupied
by the lord of the castle. From what she had seen she
was sure that her husband was the lord himself, so when
she heard the master of the house enter the room next
door she knocked upon the boards which separated it
from her own. Her husband, for he it was, replied
from the other side; then, entering her room, he
recognized his wife, and they were happily united after
the years of painful separation. To the wife&rsquo;s great joy
her husband was now completely restored to his proper
form, and nothing occurred to mar their happiness for
the rest of their lives.</p>
<h3><i>The Bride of Satan</i></h3>
<p>Weird and terrible as are many of the darksome legends of
Brittany, it may be doubted if any are more awe-inspiring
than that which we are now about to relate. &ldquo;Those
who are affianced three times without marrying shall
burn in hell,&rdquo; says an old Breton proverb, and it is
probably this aphorism which has given the Bretons
such a strong belief in the sacred nature of a betrothal.
The fantastic ballad from which this story is taken is
written in the dialect of LÃ©on, and the words are put
into the mouth of a maiden of that country. Twice
had she been betrothed. On the last occasion she had
worn a robe of the finest stuff, embroidered with twelve
brilliant stars and having the figures of the sun and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
moon painted upon it, like the lady in Madame
d&rsquo;Aulnoy&rsquo;s story of <i>Finette Cendron</i> (<i>Cinderella</i>). On
the occasion when she went to meet her third <i>fiancÃ©</i>
in church she almost fainted as she turned with her
maidens into the little road leading up to the building,
for there before her was a great lord clad in steel
<i>cap-Ã -pie</i>, wearing on his head a casque of gold, his
shoulders covered by a blood-coloured mantle. Strange
lights flashed from his eyes, which glittered under his
casque like meteors. By his side stood a huge black
steed, which ever and again struck the ground impatiently
with his hoofs, throwing up sparks of fire.</p>
<p>The priest was waiting in the church, the bridegroom
arrived, but the bride did not come. Where had she
gone? She had stepped on board a barque with the
dark steel-clad lord, and the ship passed silently over
the waters until it vanished among the shadows of
night. Then the lady turned to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gloomy waters are these through which we sail,
my lord?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Lake of Anguish,&rdquo; he replied in hollow tones.
&ldquo;We sail to the Place of Skulls, at the mouth of Hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the wretched bride wept bitterly. &ldquo;Take back
your wedding-ring!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Take back your
dowry and your bridal gifts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he answered not. Down they descended into
horrid darkness, and as the unhappy maiden fell there
rang in her ears the cries of the damned.</p>

THE BRIDE OF SATAN<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>This tale is common to many countries. The fickle
maiden is everywhere regarded among primitive peoples
with dislike and distrust. But perhaps the folk-ballad
which most nearly resembles that just related is the
Scottish ballad of <i>The Demon Lover</i>, which inspired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the late Hamish MacCunn, the gifted Scottish composer,
in the composition of his weird and striking
orchestral piece, <i>The Ship o&rsquo; the Fiend</i>.</p>
<h3><i>The Baron of Jauioz</i></h3>
<p>Another tradition which tells of the fate of an unhappy
maiden is enshrined in the ballad of <i>The Baron of
Jauioz</i>. Louis, Baron of Jauioz, in Languedoc, was
a French warrior of considerable renown who flourished
in the fourteenth century, and who took part in many
of the principal events of that stirring epoch, fighting
against the English in France and Flanders under the
Duke of Berry, his overlord. Some years later he
embarked for the Holy Land, but, if we may believe
Breton tradition, he returned, and while passing through
the duchy fell in love with and actually bought for a sum
of money a young Breton girl, whom he carried away
with him to France. The unfortunate maiden, so far
from being attracted by the more splendid environment
of his castle, languished and died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the note of the death-bird,&rdquo; the ballad begins
sadly; &ldquo;is it true, my mother, that I am sold to the
Baron of Jauioz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask your father, little Tina, ask your father,&rdquo; is the
callous reply, and the question is then put to her father,
who requests the unfortunate damsel to ask her brother,
a harsh rustic who does not scruple to tell her the
brutal truth, and adds that she must depart immediately.
The girl asks what dress she must wear, her red gown,
or her gown of white delaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters little, my daughter,&rdquo; says the heartless
mother. &ldquo;Your lover waits at the door mounted on
a great black horse. Go to him on the instant.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>As she leaves her native village the clocks are striking,
and she weeps bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu, Saint Anne!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Adieu, bells of my
native land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing the Lake of Anguish she sees a band of the
dead, white and shadowy, crossing the watery expanse
in their little boats. As she passes them she can hear
their teeth chatter. At the Valley of Blood she espies
other unfortunates. Their hearts are sunken in them
and all memory has left them.</p>
<p>After this terrible ride the Baron and Tina reach the
castle of Jauioz. The old man seats himself near the
fire. He is black and ill-favoured as a carrion crow.
His beard and his hair are white, and his eyes are like
firebrands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither to me, my child,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;come with
me from chamber to chamber that I may show you my
treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, seigneur,&rdquo; she replies, the tears falling fast, &ldquo;I
had rather be at home with my mother counting the
chips which fall from the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us descend, then, to the cellar, where I will show
you the rich wines in the great bins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, I would rather quaff the water of the fields
that my father&rsquo;s horses drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, then, to the shops, and I will buy you
a sumptuous gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better that I were wearing the working dress that
my mother made me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seigneur turns from her in anger. She lingers at
the window and watches the birds, begging them to
take a message from her to her friends.</p>
<p>At night a gentle voice whispers: &ldquo;My father, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
mother, for the love of God, pray for me!&rdquo; Then all
is silence.</p>
<p>In this striking ballad we find strong traces of the
Breton love of country and other national traits. The
death-bird alluded to is a grey bird which sings during
the winter in the Landes country in a voice soft and
sad. It is probably a bird of the osprey species. It
is thought that the girl who hears it sing is doomed to
misfortune. The strange and ghostly journey of the
unhappy Tina recalls the <i>mise en scÃ¨ne</i> of such ballads
as <i>The Bride of Satan</i>, and it would seem that she
passes through the Celtic Tartarus. It is plain that
the Seigneur of Jauioz by his purchase of their countrywoman
became so unpopular among the freedom-loving
Bretons that at length they magnified him into a species
of demon&mdash;a traditionary fate which he thoroughly deserved,
if the heartrending tale concerning his victim
has any foundation in fact.</p>
<h3><i>The Man of Honour</i></h3>
<p>The tale of the man who is helped by the grateful dead
is by no means confined to Brittany. Indeed, in folk-tale
the dead are often jealous of the living and act
toward them with fiendish malice. But in the following
we have a story in which a dead man shows his gratitude
to the living for receiving the boon of Christian
burial at his hands.</p>
<p>There was once a merchant-prince who had gained a
great fortune by trading on land and sea. Many ships
were his, and with these he traded to far countries,
reaping a rich harvest. He had a son named Iouenn,
and he was desirous that he too should embrace the
career of a merchant and become rich. When, therefore,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Iouenn declared his willingness to trade in distant
lands his father was delighted and gave him a ship
full of Breton merchandise, with instructions to sell it
to the best advantage in a foreign country and return
home with the gold thus gained.</p>
<p>After a successful voyage the vessel arrived at a
foreign port, and Iouenn presented his father&rsquo;s letters
to the merchants there, and disposed of his cargo so
well that he found himself in possession of a large sum
of money. One day as he was walking on the outskirts
of the city he saw a large number of dogs gathered
round some object, barking at it and worrying it.
Approaching them, he discovered that that which they
were worrying was nothing less than the corpse of a
man. Making inquiries, he found that the unfortunate
wretch had died deeply in debt, and that his body had
been thrown into the roadway to be eaten by the dogs.
Iouenn was shocked to see such an indignity offered to
the dead, and out of the kindness of his heart chased
the dogs away, paid the debts of the deceased, and
granted his body the last rites of sepulture.</p>
<p>A few days afterward he left the port where these
things had happened and set out on his homeward
voyage. He had not sailed far when one of the
mariners drew his attention to a strange ship a little
distance away, which appeared to be draped entirely
in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is indeed a curious vessel,&rdquo; said Iouenn.
&ldquo;Wherefore is it draped in black? and for what reason
do those on board bewail so loudly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke the ship drew nearer, and Iouenn
called to the people who thronged its decks, asking
why they made such loud laments.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! good sir,&rdquo; replied the captain of the strange
ship, &ldquo;not far from here is an island inhabited by an
enormous serpent, which for seven years has demanded
an annual tribute of a royal princess, and we are now
bearing another victim to her doom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iouenn laughed. &ldquo;Where is the Princess?&rdquo; he asked.
At that moment the Princess came on deck, weeping
and wringing her hands. Iouenn was so struck by
her beauty that he there and then declared in the most
emphatic manner that she should never become the
prey of the serpent. On learning from the captain
that he would hand over the maiden if a sufficient bribe
were forthcoming, he paid over to him the last of the
money he had gained from his trading, and taking the
Princess on his own vessel sailed homeward.</p>
<p>In due time Iouenn arrived home and was welcomed
with delight by his father; but when the old man
learned the story of what had been done with his
money he was furious; nor would he believe for a
moment that the lady his son had rescued was a veritable
princess, but chased Iouenn from his presence with
hard and bitter words. Nevertheless Iouenn married
the royal lady he had rescued, and they started housekeeping
in a tiny dwelling. Time went on, and the
Princess presented her husband with a little son, but
by this time fortune had smiled upon Iouenn, for an
uncle of his, who was also a merchant, had entrusted
him with a fine vessel to trade in Eastern lands; so,
taking with him the portraits of his wife and child, he
set out on his voyage. With a fresh wind and favourable
conditions generally he was not long in coming to
the city where his wife&rsquo;s father reigned. Now, some
mariners of the port, having entered the ship out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
curiosity, observed the portrait of the Princess, and
informed the King of the circumstance. The King
himself came to the ship and demanded to know what
had become of his daughter. Iouenn did not, of course,
realize that the monarch was his father-in-law, and
assured him that he knew nothing of his daughter,
whereupon the King, growing very angry, had him
cast into prison and ordered his ship to be broken to
pieces and burned. In prison Iouenn made friends
with his gaoler, to whom he related his history, which
the gaoler in turn told the King, with the result that
the prisoner was brought before the monarch, who
desired him to set out at once to bring his daughter
back, and for this purpose fitted him out with a new
vessel. But the old monarch took the precaution of
sending two of his ministers along with the Breton
sailor in case he should not return. The party soon
came to Brittany, and found the Princess and her
infant safe.</p>
<p>Now one of the King&rsquo;s ministers had loved the Princess
for a long time, and consequently did not regard her
husband with any great degree of favour; so when they
re-embarked on the return journey to her father&rsquo;s
kingdom her suspicions were aroused, and, fully aware
of the minister&rsquo;s crafty nature, she begged her husband
to remain with her as much as possible. But Iouenn
liked to be on the bridge, whence he could direct the
operations of his mariners, and laughed at his wife&rsquo;s
fears. One night as he leaned over the side of the
vessel, gazing upon the calm of the star-strewn sea, his
enemy approached very stealthily and, seizing him by
the legs, cast him headlong into the waters. After this
he waited for a few moments, and, hearing no sound,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
cried out that the captain had fallen overboard. A
search was made, but with no avail. The Princess was
distraught, and in the belief that her husband had
perished remained in her cabin lamenting. But Iouenn
was a capital swimmer and struck out lustily. He swam
around for a long time, without, however, encountering
any object upon which he could lay hold to support
himself. Meanwhile the ship sailed on her course, and
in due time arrived at the kingdom of the Princess&rsquo;s
father, by whom she was received with every demonstration
of joy. Great festivities were announced, and
so pleased was the old King at his daughter&rsquo;s return
that he willingly consented to her marriage with the
treacherous minister, whom he regarded as the instrument
of her deliverance. But the Princess put off the
wedding-day by every possible artifice, for she felt in
her heart that her husband was not really lost to her.</p>
<p>Let us return now to Iouenn. After swimming for
some time he came upon a barren rock in the middle
of the ocean, and here, though beaten upon by
tempests and without any manner of shelter save that
afforded by a cleft in the rock, he succeeded in living
for three years upon the shell-fish which he gathered on
the shores of his little domain. In that time he had
grown almost like a savage. His clothes had fallen off
him and he was thickly covered with matted hair. The
only mark of civilization he bore was a chain of gold encircling
his neck, the gift of his wife. One night he was
sitting in his small dwelling munching his wretched
supper of shell-fish when an eerie sound broke the
stillness. He started violently. Surely these were
human accents that he heard&mdash;yet not altogether human,
for their weird cadence held something of the supernatural,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
and cold as he was he felt himself grow still
more chilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold, cold,&rdquo; cried the voice, and a dreadful chattering
of teeth ended in a long-drawn wail of &ldquo;Hou, hou, hou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound died away and once more he was left amid
the great silence of the sea.</p>
<p>The next evening brought the same experience, but
although Iouenn was brave he dared not question his
midnight visitor. On the third occasion, however, he
demanded: &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the darkness there crawled a man completely
naked, his body covered with blood and horrible
wounds, the eyes fixed and glassy.</p>
<p>Iouenn trembled with horror. &ldquo;In the name of God,
who are you?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, so you do not remember me, Iouenn?&rdquo; asked the
phantom. &ldquo;I am that unfortunate man whose body
you gave decent burial, and now I have come to help
you in turn. Without doubt you wish to leave this
desert rock on which you have suffered so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, most devoutly,&rdquo; replied Iouenn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will have to make haste,&rdquo; said the dead
man, &ldquo;for to-morrow your wife is going to be married
to the minister of your father-in-law, the wretch who
cast you into the sea. Now if you will promise to give
me a share of all that belongs to yourself and your
wife within a year and a day, I will carry you at once
to the palace of your father-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iouenn promised to do as the phantom requested, and
the dread being then asked him to mount upon his
back. Iouenn did so, and the corpse then plunged into
the sea, and, swimming swiftly, soon brought him to
the port where his father-in-law reigned. When it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
set him safely on shore it turned and with a wave of its
gaunt white arm cried, &ldquo;In a year and a day,&rdquo; then
plunged back into the sea.</p>
<p>When the door-keeper of the palace opened the gate in
the morning he was astounded to see what appeared to
be an animal crouching on the ground outside and crying
for help. It was Iouenn. The palace lackeys crowded
round him and threw him morsels of bread, which he
devoured with avidity. One of the waiting-women told
the Princess of the strange being who crouched outside.
She descended in order to view him, and at once observed
the golden chain she had given to her husband
round his neck. Iouenn immediately rushed to embrace
her. She took him to her chamber and clothed him
suitably. By this time the bridal preparations had
been completed, and, like the Princess in the story of
the Miller of LÃ©guer, the bride asked the advice of the
company as to whether it were better to search for an
old key that fitted a coffer in her possession or make
use of a new key which did not fit; the coffer, of course,
being her heart and the respective keys her husband
and the minister. All the company advised searching
for the old key, when she produced Iouenn and explained
what she had meant. The crafty minister grew
pale as death at sight of Iouenn, and the King stormed
furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, there!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;build a great fire, varlets,
and cast this slave into it.&rdquo; All the company thought
at first that his words were intended to apply to Iouenn,
but when they saw him point at the minister whose guilt
the Princess had made plain, they applauded and the
wretch was hurried away to his doom.</p>
<p>Iouenn and the Princess lived happily at the Court, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
in time a second little son was born to them. Their
first child had died, and they were much rejoiced at
its place being filled. Iouenn had entirely forgotten
his indebtedness to the dead man, but one day in the
month of November, when his wife was sitting quietly
by the fire nursing her infant, with her husband
opposite her, three loud knocks resounded upon the
door, which flew open and revealed the horrible form
of the corpse to which Iouenn owed his freedom. The
Princess shrieked at sight of the phantom, which said
in deep tones: &ldquo;Iouenn, remember thy bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling, Iouenn turned to his wife and asked her
for the keys of their treasure-house, that he might give
their terrible visitor a portion of their wealth, but with a
disdainful wave of its arm the apparition bade him cease.
&ldquo;It is not your wealth I require, Iouenn,&rdquo; it said in
hollow tones. &ldquo;Behold that which I desire,&rdquo; and it
pointed to the infant slumbering in its mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Once more the Princess cried aloud, and clasped her
little one to her bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My infant!&rdquo; cried Iouenn in despair. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are a man of honour,&rdquo; said the corpse, &ldquo;think
of your promise made on the barren rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Iouenn, wringing his hands, &ldquo;but oh,
remember how I saved your body from the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only ask what is my due,&rdquo; said the ghost. &ldquo;Besides,
I do not desire all your infant, but a share of it only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Iouenn, &ldquo;are you without a heart?
Have then your wish, for honour with me is above all.&rdquo;
The infant was then undressed and laid between the
two upon a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your sword,&rdquo; said the phantom, &ldquo;and cut off a
portion for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I would that I were on that desert rock in the
middle of the ocean!&rdquo; cried the unhappy father. He
raised his weapon and was about to strike, when the
phantom called upon him to hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harm not your infant, Iouenn,&rdquo; it cried. &ldquo;I see
clearly that you are a man of honour and that you have
not forgotten the service I rendered you; nor do I fail
to remember what you did for me, and how it is through
you that I am able to dwell in Paradise, which I would
not have been permitted to enter had my debts not
been paid and my body given burial. Farewell, until
we meet above.&rdquo; And with these words the apparition
vanished.</p>
<p>Iouenn and the Princess lived long, respected by all,
and when the old King died Iouenn, the man of his
word, was made King in his place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI: BRETON FOLK-TALES</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> stories told here under the title of &lsquo;folk-tales&rsquo;
are such as do not partake so much of
the universal element which enters so largely
into Breton romance, but those which have a more
national or even local tinge and are yet not legendary.
The homely flavour attached to many stories of this
kind is very apparent, and it is evident that they have
been put together in oral form by unknown &lsquo;makers,&rsquo;
some of whom had either a natural or artistic aptitude
for story-telling. In the first of the following tales it
is curious to note how the ancient Breton theme has
been put by its peasant narrator into almost a modern
dress.</p>
<h3><i>The Magic Rose</i></h3>
<p>An aged Breton couple had two sons, the elder of
whom went to Paris to seek his fortune, while the
younger one was timid by nature and would not leave
the paternal roof. His mother, who felt the burden of
her age, wished the stay-at-home to marry. At first he
would not hear of the idea, but at last, persuaded by
her, he took a wife. He had only been married a few
weeks, however, when his young bride sickened and
died. La Rose, for such was his name, was inconsolable.
Every evening he went to the cemetery where
his wife was buried, and wept over her tomb.</p>
<p>One night he was about to enter the graveyard on his
sad errand when he beheld a terrible phantom standing
before him, which asked him in awful tones what he did
there.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to pray at the tomb of my wife,&rdquo; replied
the terrified La Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish that she were alive again?&rdquo; asked the
spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; cried the sorrowing husband. &ldquo;There is
nothing that I would not do in order that she might be
restored to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken, then,&rdquo; said the phantom. &ldquo;Return to this
place to-morrow night at the same hour. Provide yourself
with a pick and you will see what comes to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following night the young widower was punctually
at the rendezvous. The phantom presented itself
before him and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the tomb of your wife and strike it with your
pick; the earth will turn aside and you will behold her
lying in her shroud. Take this little silver box, which
contains a rose; open it and pass it before her nostrils
three times, when she will awake as if from a deep
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Rose hastened to the tomb of his wife, and everything
happened as the phantom had predicted. He
placed the box containing the rose to his wife&rsquo;s nostrils
and she awoke with a sigh, saying: &ldquo;Ah, I have been
asleep for a long time.&rdquo; Her husband provided her
with clothes which he had brought with him, and they
returned to their house, much to the joy of his parents.</p>
<p>Some time afterward La Rose&rsquo;s father died at a great
age, and the grief-stricken mother was not long in
following him to the grave. La Rose wrote to his
brother in Paris to return to Brittany in order to receive
his portion of the paternal inheritance, but he was
unable to leave the capital, so La Rose had perforce
to journey to Paris. He promised his wife before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
leaving that he would write to her every day, but on
his arrival in the city he found his brother very ill, and
in the anxiety of nursing him back to health he quite
forgot to send his wife news of how he fared.</p>
<p>The weeks passed and La Rose&rsquo;s wife, without word of
her husband, began to dread that something untoward
had happened to him. Day by day she sat at her
window weeping and watching for the courier who
brought letters from Paris. A regiment of dragoons
chanced to be billeted in the town, and the captain,
who lodged at the inn directly opposite La Rose&rsquo;s
house, was greatly attracted by the young wife. He
inquired of the landlady who was the beautiful dame
who sat constantly weeping at her window, and learned
the details of her history. He wrote a letter to her
purporting to come from La Rose&rsquo;s brother in Paris,
telling her that her husband had died in the capital,
and some time after paid his addresses to the supposed
widow, who accepted him. They were married, and
when the regiment left the town the newly wedded pair
accompanied it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile La Rose&rsquo;s brother recovered from his illness,
and the eager husband hastened back to Brittany. But
when he arrived at his home he was surprised to find
the doors closed, and was speedily informed of what
had occurred during his absence. For a while he was
too grief-stricken to act, but, recovering himself somewhat,
he resolved to enlist in the regiment of dragoons
in which the false captain held his commission. The
beauty of his handwriting procured him the post of
secretary to one of the lieutenants, but although he
frequently attempted to gain sight of his wife he never
succeeded in doing so. One day the captain entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
the lieutenant&rsquo;s office, observed the writing of La Rose,
and asked his brother officer if he would kindly lend
him his secretary for a few days to assist him with some
correspondence. While helping the captain La Rose
beheld his wife, who did not, however, recognize him.
Greatly pleased with his work, the captain invited him to
dinner. During the repast a servant, who had stolen a
silver dish, fearing that it was about to be missed, slid
it into La Rose&rsquo;s pocket, and when it could not be
found, accused the secretary of the theft. La Rose was
brought before a court-martial, which condemned him
to be shot.</p>
<p>While in prison awaiting his execution La Rose struck
up an acquaintance with an old veteran named PÃ¨re La
Chique, who brought him his meals and seemed kindly
disposed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PÃ¨re La Chique,&rdquo; said La Rose one day, &ldquo;I have two
thousand francs; if you will do as I ask you they shall
be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veteran promised instantly, and La Rose requested
that after he was shot La Chique should go to the
cemetery where he was buried and resuscitate him with
the magic rose, which he had carefully preserved. On
the appointed day La Rose was duly executed, but
PÃ¨re La Chique, with his pockets full of money, went
from inn to inn, drinking and making merry. Whenever
the thought of La Rose crossed his mind, he muttered
to himself in bibulous accents: &ldquo;Poor fellow, poor
fellow, he is better dead. This is a weary world; why
should I bring him back to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When PÃ¨re La Chique had caroused with his comrades
for some days the two thousand francs had almost disappeared.
Then remorse assailed him and he made up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
his mind to do as La Rose had wished. Taking a pick
and an axe he went to the graveyard, but when he
struck the grave with his tools and the earth rolled
back, disclosing the body of La Rose, the old fellow
was so terrified that he ran helter-skelter from the spot.
A draught of good wine brought back his failing courage,
however, and he returned and passed the rose three
times under the nostrils of his late acquaintance.
Instantly La Rose sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my faith, I&rsquo;ve had a good sleep!&rdquo; he said, rubbing
his eyes. &ldquo;Where are my clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>PÃ¨re La Chique handed him his garments, and after he
had donned them they quitted the graveyard with all
haste.</p>
<p>La Rose now found it necessary to cast about for a
living. One day he heard the sound of a drum in the
street, and, following it, found that it was beaten by a
crier who promised in the King&rsquo;s name a large reward
to those who would enlist as sentinels to guard a chapel
where the King&rsquo;s daughter, who had been changed into
a monster, was imprisoned. La Rose accepted the offer,
and then learned to his dismay that the sentinel who
guarded the place between the hours of eleven and
midnight was never seen again. On the very first night
that he took up his duties this perilous watch fell to his
lot. He felt his courage deserting him, and he was
about to fly when he heard a voice say: &ldquo;La Rose,
where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Rose trembled. &ldquo;What do you wish with me?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken to me, and no evil will befall you,&rdquo; replied
the voice. &ldquo;Soon a great and grisly beast will appear.
Leave your musket by the side of the sentry-box,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
climb on the top, and the beast will not touch
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As eleven o&rsquo;clock struck La Rose heard a noise and
hastened to climb on the top of the sentry-box. Soon
a hideous monster came out of the chapel, breathing
flames and crying: &ldquo;Sentinel of my father, where art
thou, that I may devour thee?&rdquo; As it uttered these
words, it fell against the musket, which it seized between
its teeth. Then the creature disappeared into the
chapel and La Rose descended from his perch. He
found the musket broken into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>The old King was delighted to learn that his sentinel
had not been devoured, for in order that his daughter
should be delivered from her enchantment as a beast
it was necessary that the same sentinel should mount
guard for three consecutive nights between the hours of
eleven and midnight.</p>
<p>On the following night La Rose was pacing up and
down on guard, when the same voice addressed him,
telling him on this occasion to place his musket before
the door of the chapel. The beast issued as before,
seized the musket, broke it into small pieces, and
returned to the chapel. On the third night the voice
advised him to throw open the door of the chapel, and
when the beast came out to run into the building himself,
where he would see a leaden shrine, behind which he
could take refuge, and where he would find a small bottle,
with the contents of which he was to sprinkle the beast&rsquo;s
head. With its usual dreadful roar the monster issued
from the chapel. La Rose leapt past it and ran for the
leaden shrine. It followed him with hideous howls, and
he only reached the protective sanctuary in time.
Seizing the little bottle which lay there, he fearlessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
fronted the beast and sprinkled its contents over its
head. Instantly it changed into a beautiful princess,
whom La Rose escorted to her delighted parents.
La Rose and the princess were betrothed and duly
married, and shortly afterward the King gave up his
throne to his son-in-law.</p>
<p>One day the new King was inspecting the regiment of
dragoons to which he had once belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I miss a man from your regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, sire,&rdquo; replied the Colonel. &ldquo;It is an old
fellow called PÃ¨re La Chique, whom we have left at the
barracks playing his violin, the old good-for-nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see him,&rdquo; said the King.</p>
<p>PÃ¨re La Chique was brought forward trembling, and
the King, tearing the epaulettes from the shoulders of
the captain who had stolen his wife, placed them on
those of PÃ¨re La Chique. He then gave orders for a
great fire to be lit, in which were burned the wicked
captain and the wife who had so soon forgotten her
husband.</p>
<p>La Rose and his Queen lived happily ever afterward&mdash;which
is rather odd, is it not, when one thinks of the
treatment meted out to his resuscitated spouse? But
if the lights in folk-tale are bright, the shadows are
correspondingly heavy, and rarely does justice go hand
in hand with mercy in legend!</p>
<h3><i>Norouas, the North-west Wind</i></h3>
<p>Brittany has an entire cycle of folk-tales dealing with
the subject of the winds&mdash;which, indeed, play an
extraordinary part in Breton folk-lore. The fishermen
of the north coast frequently address the winds as
if they were living beings, hurling opprobrious epithets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
at them if the direction in which they blow does not
suit their purpose, shaking their fists at them in a most
menacing manner the while. The following story, the
only wind-tale it is possible to give here, well illustrates
this personalization of the winds by the Breton folk.</p>
<p>There was once a goodman and his wife who had a
little field on which they grew flax. One season their
patch yielded a particularly fine crop, and after it had
been cut they laid it out to dry. But Norouas, the
North-west Wind, came along and with one sweep of
his mighty wings tossed it as high as the tree-tops, so
that it fell into the sea and was lost.</p>
<p>When the goodman saw what had happened he began
to swear at the Wind, and, taking his stick, he set out
to follow and slay Norouas, who had spoiled his flax.
So hasty had he been in setting forth that he had
taken no food or money with him, and when evening
came he arrived at an inn hungry and penniless. He
explained his plight to the hostess, who gave him a
morsel of bread and permitted him to sleep in a corner
of the stable. In the morning he asked the dame the
way to the abode of Norouas, and she conducted him
to the foot of a mountain, where she said the Winds
dwelt.</p>
<p>The goodman climbed the mountain, and at the top
met with Surouas, the South-west Wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you he whom they call Norouas?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am Surouas,&rdquo; said the South-west Wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where then is that villain Norouas?&rdquo; cried the goodman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Surouas, &ldquo;do not speak so loud, goodman,
for if he hears you he will toss you into the air
like a straw.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>At that moment Norouas arrived, whistling wildly and
vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, thief of a Norouas,&rdquo; cried the goodman, &ldquo;it was
you who stole my beautiful crop of flax!&rdquo; But the Wind
took no notice of him. Nevertheless he did not cease
to cry: &ldquo;Norouas, Norouas, give me back my flax!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; cried Norouas. &ldquo;Here is a napkin that
will perhaps make you keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my crop of flax,&rdquo; howled the goodman, &ldquo;I could
have made a hundred napkins such as this. Norouas,
give me back my flax!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent, fellow,&rdquo; said Norouas. &ldquo;This is no common
napkin which I give you. You have only to say,
&lsquo;Napkin, unfold thyself,&rsquo; to have the best spread table
in the world standing before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goodman took the napkin with a grumble, descended
the mountain, and there, only half believing what
Norouas had said, placed the napkin before him, saying,
&ldquo;Napkin, unfold thyself.&rdquo; Immediately a table appeared
spread with a princely repast. The odour of cunningly
cooked dishes arose, and rare wines sparkled in glittering
vessels. After he had feasted the table vanished,
and the goodman folded up his napkin and went back
to the inn where he had slept the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you get any satisfaction out of Norouas?&rdquo;
asked the hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I did,&rdquo; replied the goodman, producing the
napkin. &ldquo;Behold this: Napkin, unfold thyself!&rdquo; and
as he spoke the magic table appeared before their eyes.
The hostess, struck dumb with astonishment, at once
became covetous and resolved to have the napkin for
herself. So that night she placed the goodman in a
handsome apartment where there was a beautiful bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
with a soft feather mattress, on which he slept more
soundly than ever he had done in his life. When he
was fast asleep the cunning hostess entered the room
and stole the napkin, leaving one of similar appearance
in its place.</p>
<p>In the morning the goodman set his face homeward,
and duly arrived at his little farm. His wife eagerly
asked him if Norouas had made good the damage done
to the flax, to which her husband replied affirmatively
and drew the substituted napkin from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; quoth the dame, &ldquo;we could have made two
hundred napkins like this out of the flax that was
destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but,&rdquo; said the goodman, &ldquo;this napkin is not the
same as others. I have only to say, &lsquo;Napkin, unfold
thyself,&rsquo; and a table covered with a most splendid feast
appears. Napkin, unfold thyself&mdash;unfold thyself, dost
thou hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an old fool, goodman,&rdquo; said his wife when
nothing happened. Her husband&rsquo;s jaw dropped and
he seized his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been sold by that rascal Norouas,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Well, I shall not spare him this time,&rdquo; and without
more ado he rushed out of the house and took the road
to the home of the Winds.</p>
<p>He slept as before at the inn, and next morning climbed
the mountain. He began at once to call loudly upon
Norouas, who was whistling up aloft, demanding that
he should return him his crop of flax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, down there!&rdquo; cried Norouas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be quiet!&rdquo; screamed the goodman, brandishing
his bludgeon. &ldquo;You have made matters worse
by cheating me with that napkin of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, then,&rdquo; replied Norouas, &ldquo;here is an ass;
you have only to say &lsquo;Ass, make me some gold,&rsquo; and
it will fall from his tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goodman, eager to test the value of the new gift,
at once led the ass to the foot of the mountain and
said: &ldquo;Ass, make me some gold.&rdquo; The ass shook his
tail, and a <i>rouleau</i> of gold pieces fell to the ground.
The goodman hastened to the inn, where, as before,
he displayed the phenomenon to the hostess, who that
night went into the stable and exchanged for the
magical animal another similar in appearance to it. On
the evening of the following day the goodman returned
home and acquainted his wife with his good luck, but
when he charged the ass to make gold and nothing
happened, she railed at him once more for a fool, and
in a towering passion he again set out to slay Norouas.
Arrived at the mountain for the third time, he called
loudly on the North-west Wind, and when he came
heaped insults and reproaches upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softly,&rdquo; replied Norouas; &ldquo;I am not to blame for your
misfortune. You must know that it is the hostess at
the inn where you slept who is the guilty party, for
she stole your napkin and your ass. Take this cudgel.
When you say to it, &lsquo;Strike, cudgel,&rsquo; it will at once
attack your enemies, and when you want it to stop you
have only to cry, &lsquo;<i>Ora pro nobis</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goodman, eager to test the efficacy of the cudgel,
at once said to it, &ldquo;Strike, cudgel,&rdquo; whereupon it commenced
to belabour him so soundly that he yelled,
&ldquo;<i>Ora pro nobis!</i>&rdquo; when it ceased.</p>
<p>Returning to the inn in a very stormy mood, he loudly
demanded the return of his napkin and his ass, whereupon
the hostess threatened to fetch the gendarmes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Strike, cudgel!&rdquo; cried the goodman, and the stick
immediately set about the hostess in such vigorous style
that she cried to the goodman to call it off and she
would at once return his ass and his napkin.</p>
<p>When his property had been returned to him the
goodman lost no time in making his way homeward,
where he rejoiced his wife by the sight of the treasures
he brought with him. He rapidly grew rich, and his
neighbours, becoming suspicious at the sight of so
much wealth, had him arrested and brought before a
magistrate on a charge of wholesale murder and
robbery. He was sentenced to death, and on the day
of his execution he was about to mount the scaffold,
when he begged as a last request that his old cudgel
might be brought him. The boon was granted, and no
sooner had the stick been given into his hands than he
cried, &ldquo;Strike, cudgel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cudgel <i>did</i> strike. It belaboured judge,
gendarmes, and spectators in such a manner that they
fled howling from the scene. It demolished the scaffold
and cracked the hangman&rsquo;s crown. A great cry for
mercy arose. The goodman was instantly pardoned,
and was never further molested in the enjoyment of
the treasures the North-west Wind had given him as
compensation for his crop of flax.</p>
<h3><i>The Foster-Brother</i></h3>
<p>The weird tale which follows has many parallels in
world folk-lore, but is localized at TrÃ©guier, an old
cathedral town in the CÃ´tes-du-Nord at the junction
of the Jaudy and the Guindy, famous for the beautiful
windows of its celebrated church, founded by St Tugdual.</p>
<p>GwennolaÃ¯k was the most noble and beautiful maiden in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
TrÃ©guier, but, alas! she was almost friendless, for at an
early age she had lost her father, her mother, and her
two sisters, and her sole remaining relative was her
stepmother. Pitiful it was to see her standing at the
door of her manor, weeping as if her heart would break.
But although she had none of her own blood to cherish
she still nursed the hope that her foster-brother, who
had journeyed abroad for some years, might one day
return, and often would she stand gazing fixedly over
the sea as if in search of the vessel that would bring him
home. They had been playmates, and although six
years had passed since he had left the country, the time
had gone quickly, and when GwennolaÃ¯k thought of the
young man it was as the boy who had shared the
games and little amusements of her childhood. From
these day-dreams she would be rudely awakened by the
harsh voice of her stepmother calling to her: &ldquo;Come
here, my girl, and attend to the animals. I don&rsquo;t feed
you for loafing and doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor GwennolaÃ¯k had a sad life with her stepmother.
Noble as she was she was yet forced by the vindictive
old woman to rise in the early hours of the morning,
even two or three hours before daylight in winter,
to light the fire and sweep the house and perform
other menial work. One evening as she was breaking
the ice in the well in order to draw water for the
household she was interrupted by a cavalier returning
to Nantes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good e&rsquo;en to you, maiden. Are you affianced to
anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not reply, but hung her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the handsome horseman,
&ldquo;but answer my question.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>She looked at him almost fearfully. &ldquo;Saving your
grace, I have never been affianced to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied the cavalier. &ldquo;Take this gold ring
and say to your stepmother that you are now affianced
to a cavalier of Nantes who has been in a great battle
and who has lost his squire in the combat; and you
may also add that he has been wounded in the side by
a sword-stroke. In three weeks and three days, when
my wound is healed, I will return and will take you to
my manor with joy and festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden returned to the house and looked at the
ring. It was the same as her foster-brother used to
wear on his left hand!</p>
<p>Three weeks ran by, but the cavalier did not return.
Then the stepmother said one morning: &ldquo;It is time,
daughter, that you should marry, and I may tell you
that I have found you a husband after my own heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving your grace, good stepmother, I do not wish
to marry anyone except my foster-brother, who has returned.
He has given me a golden wedding-ring, and
has promised to come for me within a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fig for your gold ring,&rdquo; cried the malignant hag.
&ldquo;<i>Bon grÃ©, mal grÃ©</i>, you shall marry Job the Witless,
the stable boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry Job! Oh, horror! I should die of grief! Alas,
my mother, were you but here now to protect me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must howl, pray do so in the courtyard. You
may make as many grimaces as you please, but in
three days you shall be married for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The old gravedigger slowly patrolled the road, his
bell in his hand, carrying the news of those who had
died from village to village. In his doleful whine he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
cried: &ldquo;Pray for the soul of a noble cavalier, a worthy
gentleman of a good heart, who was mortally wounded
in the side by the stroke of a sword in the battle near
Nantes. He is to be buried to-day in the White
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the marriage feast the bride was all in tears. All
the guests, young and old, wept with her, all except
her stepmother. She was conducted to the place of
honour at supper-time, but she only drank a sip of water
and ate a morsel of bread. By and by the dancing
commenced, but when it was proposed that the bride
should join in the revels she was not to be found; she
had, indeed, escaped from the house, her hair flying in
disorder, and where she had gone no one knew.</p>
<p>All the lights were out at the manor, every one slept
profoundly. The poor young woman alone lay concealed
in the garden in the throes of a fever. She
heard a footstep close by. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she asked
fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I, Nola, your foster-brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, is it you? You are truly welcome, my dear
brother,&rdquo; cried GwennolaÃ¯k, rising in rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he whispered, and swinging her on
to the crupper of his white horse he plunged madly
into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fly fast,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We must have ridden a
hundred leagues, I think. Ah, but I am happy with
thee! I will never leave thee more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owl hooted and night noises came to her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but thy horse is swift,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and thine
armour, how brilliant it is! How happy I am to have
found thee, my foster-brother! But are we near thy
manor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall arrive there in good time, my sister,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy heart is cold, thy hair is wet! Ah, how chill are
thy hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, my sister; do you not hear the noise of the
gay musicians who shall play at our wedding?&rdquo; He
had not finished speaking when his horse threw itself
back on its haunches all at once, trembling and whinnying
loudly.</p>
<p>GwennolaÃ¯k looked around, and found herself on an
island where a crowd of people were dancing. Lads
and lasses, they danced most bravely beneath the green
trees heavy with apples, and the music to which they
tripped was as that of heaven.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sun rose above the eastern mountains
and flooded this strange new world with rich light, and
there GwennolaÃ¯k found her mother and her two sisters,
and there was nothing in her heart but beauty and
joy.</p>
<p>On the following morning, as the sun rose, the young
women carried the body of GwennolaÃ¯k and laid it
in the tomb of her foster-brother in the White
Church.</p>
<p>In this ballad&mdash;for the original from which we take the
tale is cast in ballad form&mdash;we are once more in touch
with the Celtic Otherworld. It is a thousand pities
that this interesting piece breaks off where it does, thus
failing to provide us with a fuller account of that most
elusive realm. The short glimpse we do get of it,
however, reminds us very much of the descriptions of
it we possess in Irish lore. We have also once more
the phenomenon of the dead lover who comes to claim
the living bride, the midnight gallop, and other circumstances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
characteristic of ballad literature. There was
a tradition in Lower Brittany, however, that no soul
might be admitted to the other world which had not
first received burial, but here, of course, we must look
for Christian influence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII: POPULAR LEGENDS OF BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>T</span><span class="dcap">he</span> legend,&rdquo; says Gomme, in a passage most
memorable for students of folk-lore as containing
his acute and precise definition of the
several classes of tradition, &ldquo;belongs to an historical
personage, locality, or event,&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0040' id='FNanchor_0040'></a><a href='#Footnote_0040' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> and it is in this general
sense that the term is employed in regard to the
contents of this chapter, unless where mythic or folk-lore
matter is introduced for the sake of analogy or
illustration. There is, however, a broad, popular reading
of the term as indicating the fanciful-historical.
When we read of the King of Ys, or Arthur, for example,
we are not aware whether they ever existed or not, but
they are alluded to by tradition as ancient rulers of
Brittany and Britain, just as Cymbeline and Cole are
spoken of as British monarchs of the distant past.
They linger as personal figures in the folk-memory, but
they scarcely seem as the personages of folk-tale. Let
us say, then, for the purposes of our classification of
Breton tradition, that we include in the term &lsquo;legend&rsquo;
all tales of great personal figures who are historical or
over whom folk-tale has cast an historical <i>vraisemblance</i>,
remembering at the same time that in the case of personages
whose existence is doubtful we may be dealing
with a folk-tale disguised or even a distorted myth.</p>
<h3><i>The Dark Story of Gilles de Retz</i></h3>
<p>Of the dark and terrible legends to which Brittany has
given birth, one of the most gloomy and romantic is the
story of Gilles de Retz, alchemist, magician, and arch-criminal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
But the story is not altogether legendary,
although it has undoubtedly been added to from the
great stores of tradition. Gilles is none other than the
Bluebeard of the nursery tale, for he appears to have
actually worn a beard bluish-black in hue, and it is
probable that his personality became mingled with that
of the hero of the old Oriental story.</p>
<p>Gilles de Laval, Lord of Retz and Marshal of France,
was connected with some of the noblest families in
Brittany, those of Montmorency, Rocey, and Craon,
and at his father&rsquo;s death, about 1424, he found himself
lord of many princely domains, and what, for those
times, was almost unlimited power and wealth. He
was a handsome youth, lithe and of fascinating address,
courageous, and learned as any clerk. A splendid
career lay before him, but from the first that distorted
idea of the romantic which is typical of certain minds
had seized upon him, and despite his rank and position
he much preferred the dark courses which finally ended
in his disgrace and ruin to the dignities of his seigneury.</p>
<p>Gilles took his principal title from the barony of Retz
or Rais, south of the Loire, on the marches of Brittany.
As a youth he did nothing to justify an evil augury
of his future, for he served with zeal and gallantry in
the wars of Charles VI against the English and fought
under Jeanne Darc at the siege of OrlÃ©ans. In virtue
of these services, and because of his shrewdness and
skill in affairs, the King created him Marshal of France.
But from that time onward the man who had been the
able lieutenant of Jeanne Darc and had fought by her
side at Jargeau and Patay began to deteriorate. Some
years before he had married Catherine de Thouars, and
with her had received a large dowry; but he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
expended immense sums in the national cause, and his
private life was as extravagant as that of a prince in a
fairy tale. At his castle of ChamptocÃ© he dwelt in
almost royal state; indeed, his train when he went
hawking or hunting exceeded in magnificence that of
the King himself. His retainers were tricked out in the
most gorgeous liveries, and his table was spread with
ruinous abundance. Oxen, sheep, and pigs were roasted
whole, and viands were provided daily for five hundred
persons. He had an insane love of pomp and display,
and his private devotions were ministered to by a
large body of ecclesiastics. His chapel was a marvel
of splendour, and was furnished with gold and
silver plate in the most lavish manner. His love of
colour and movement made him fond of theatrical
displays, and it is even said that the play or mystery
of OrlÃ©ans, dealing with the story of Jeanne Darc, was
written with his own hand. He was munificent in his
patronage of the arts, and was himself a skilled illuminator
and bookbinder. In short, he was obviously one
of those persons of abnormal character in whom genius
is allied to madness and who can attempt and execute
nothing except in a spirit of the wildest excess.</p>
<p>The reduction of his fortune merely served his peculiar
and abnormal personality with a new excuse for extravagance.
At this time the art of alchemy flourished
exceedingly and the works of Nicolas Flamel, the
Arabian Geber, and Pierre d&rsquo;Estaing enjoyed a great
vogue. On an evil day it occurred to Gilles to turn
alchemist, and thus repair his broken fortunes. In the
first quarter of the fifteenth century alchemy stood for
scientific achievement, and many persons in our own
enlightened age still study its maxims. A society
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
exists to-day the object of which is to further the
knowledge of alchemical science. A common misapprehension
is current to the effect that the object of the
alchemists was the transmutation of the baser metals
into gold, but in reality they were divided into two
groups, those who sought eagerly the secret of manufacturing
the precious metals, and those who dreamed
of a higher aim, the transmutation of the gross, terrestrial
nature of man into the pure gold of the spirit.</p>
<p>The latter of these aims was beyond the fevered imagination
of such a wild and disorderly mind as that of Gilles
de Retz. He sent emissaries into Italy, Spain, and
Germany to invite adepts in the science to his castle at
ChamptocÃ©. From among these he selected two men
to assist him in his plan&mdash;Prelati, an alchemist of Padua,
and a certain physician of Poitou, whose name is not
recorded. At their instigation he built a magnificent
laboratory, and when it was completed commenced to
experiment. A year passed, during which the necessities
of the &lsquo;science&rsquo; gradually emptied many bags of gold,
but none returned to the Marshal&rsquo;s coffers. The
alchemists slept soft and fed sumptuously, and were
quite content to pursue their labours so long as the
Seigneur of Retz had occasion for their services. But
as the time passed that august person became greatly
impatient, and so irritable did he grow because of the
lack of results that at length his assistants, in imminent
fear of dismissal, communicated to him a dark and
dreadful secret of their art, which, they assured him,
would assist them at arriving speedily at the desired end.</p>
<p>The nature of the experiment they proposed was so
grotesque that its acceptance by Gilles proves that he
was either insane or a victim of the superstition of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
time. His wretched accomplices told him that the Evil
One alone was capable of revealing the secret of the
transmutation of the baser metals into gold, and they
offered to summon him to their master&rsquo;s aid. They
assured Gilles that Satan would require a recompense
for his services, and the Marshal retorted that so long
as he saved his soul intact he was quite willing to
conclude any bargain that the Father of Evil might
propose.</p>
<p>It was arranged that the ceremony should take place
within a gloomy wood in the neighbourhood. The
nameless physician conducted the Lord of Retz to a
small clearing in this plantation, where the magic circle
was drawn and the usual conjurations made. For half
an hour they waited in silence, and then a great
trembling fell upon the physician. A deadly pallor
overspread his countenance. His knees shook, he
muttered wildly, and at last he sank to the ground.
Gilles stood by unmoved. The insanity of egotism
is of course productive of great if not lofty courage,
and he feared neither man nor fiend. Suddenly the
alchemist regained consciousness and told his master
that the Devil had appeared to him in the shape of
a leopard and had growled at him horribly. He
ascribed Gilles&rsquo; lack of supernatural vision to want of
faith. He then declared that the Evil One had told
him where certain herbs grew in Spain and Africa, the
juices of which possessed the power to effect the transmutation,
and these he obligingly offered to search for,
provided the Lord of Retz furnished the means for his
travels. This Gilles gladly did, and of course never
beheld the Poitevin knave again.</p>
<p>Days and months passed and the physician did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
return. Gilles grew uneasy. It was imperative that
gold should be forthcoming immediately, for not only
was he being pressed on every side, but he was unable
to support his usual magnificence. In this dilemma he
turned to Prelati, his remaining alchemical assistant.
This man appears to have believed in his art or he
would not have made the terrible suggestion he did,
which was that the Lord of Retz should sign with his
own blood a compact with the Devil, and should offer
up a young child in sacrifice to him. To this proposal
the unhappy Gilles consented. On the following night
Prelati quitted the castle, and returned shortly afterward
with the story that the fiend had appeared to him in the
likeness of a young man who desired to be called Barron,
and had pointed out to him the resting-place of a hoard
of ingots of pure gold, buried under an oak in the
neighbouring wood. Certain conditions, however, must
be observed before the treasure was dug up, the chief
of which was that it must not be searched for until a
period of seven times seven weeks had elapsed, or it
would turn into slates. With these conditions de Retz
would not comply, and, alarmed at his annoyance, the
obliging Prelati curtailed the time of waiting to seven
times seven days. At the end of that period the
alchemist and his dupe repaired to the wood to dig up
the treasure. They worked hard for some time, and at
length came upon a load of slates, inscribed with magical
characters. Prelati pretended great wrath, and upbraided
the Evil One for his deceit, in which denunciation
he was heartily joined by de Retz. But so
credulous was the Seigneur that he allowed himself to
be persuaded to afford Satan another trial, which meant,
of course, that Prelati led him on from day to day with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
specious promises and ambiguous hints, until he had
drained him of nearly all his remaining substance. He
was then preparing to decamp with his plunder when a
dramatic incident detained him.</p>

THE DEVIL IN THE FORM OF A LEOPARD APPEARS BEFORE THE ALCHEMIST<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>For some time a rumour had been circulating in the
country-side that numerous children were missing and
that they had been spirited away. Popular clamour ran
high, and suspicion was directed toward the castle of
ChamptocÃ©. So circumstantial was the evidence against
de Retz that at length the Duke of Brittany ordered
both the Seigneur and his accomplice to be arrested.
Their trial took place before a commission which de
Retz denounced, declaring that he would rather be
hanged like a dog, without trial, than plead before its
members. But the evidence against him was overwhelming.
It was told how the wretched madman, in
his insane quest for gold, had sacrificed his innocent
victims on the altar of Satan, and how he had gloated
over their sufferings. Finally he confessed his enormities
and told how nearly a hundred children had
been cruelly murdered by him and his relentless accomplice.
Both he and Prelati were doomed to be
burned alive, but in consideration of his rank he was
strangled before being cast into the flames. Before
the execution he expressed to Prelati a hope that they
would meet in Paradise, and, it is said, met his end very
devoutly.</p>
<p>The castle of ChamptocÃ© still stands in its beautiful
valley, and many romantic legends cluster about its
grey old walls. &ldquo;The hideous, half-burnt body of the
monster himself,&rdquo; says Trollope, &ldquo;circled with flames&mdash;pale,
indeed, and faint in colour, but more lasting than
those the hangman kindled around his mortal form in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the meadow under the walls of Nantes&mdash;is seen, on
bright moonlight nights, standing now on one topmost
point of craggy wall, and now on another, and is heard
mingling his moan with the sough of the night-wind.
Pale, bloodless forms, too, of youthful growth and mien,
the restless, unsepulchred ghosts of the unfortunates
who perished in these dungeons unassoiled ... may at
similar times be seen flitting backward and forward, in
numerous groups, across the space enclosed by the ruined
wall, with more than mortal speed, or glancing hurriedly
from window to window of the fabric, as still seeking to
escape from its hateful confinement.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0041' id='FNanchor_0041'></a><a href='#Footnote_0041' class='fnanchor'>[41]</a></p>
<h3><i>Comorre the Cursed</i></h3>
<p>As has been said, the story of Gilles de Retz is connected
by tradition with that of Bluebeard, but it is probable that
this traditional connexion arises simply from the association
of two famous tales. The other legend in question
is that of Comorre the Cursed, whose story is told in
the frescoes which cover the wall of the church of St
Nicolas de Bieuzy, dedicated to St Triphyne, in which
the tale of Bluebeard is depicted as the story of the
saint, who in history was the wife of Comorre. Comorre
was a chief who ruled at Carhaix, in FinistÃ¨re, and his
tale, which owes its modern dress to Ãmile Souvestre,
himself a Breton, and author of <i>Derniers Bretons</i> and
the brilliant sketch <i>Un Philosophe sous les Toits</i>. The
tale, translated, runs as follows:</p>
<p>Guerech, Count of Vannes, &lsquo;the Country of White Corn,&rsquo;
had a daughter, Triphyna, whom he tenderly loved.
One day ambassadors arrived from Comorre, a prince
of Cornouaille, &lsquo;the Country of Black Corn,&rsquo; demanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
her in marriage. Now this caused great distress, for
Comorre was a giant, and one of the wickedest of men,
held in awe by every one for his cruelty. As a boy,
when he went out, his mother used to ring a bell to
warn people of his approach; and when unsuccessful
in the chase he would set his dogs on the peasants to
tear them to pieces. But most horrible of all, he had
had four wives, who had all died one after the other,
it was suspected either by the knife, fire, water, or
poison. The Count of Vannes, therefore, dismissed
the ambassadors, and advanced to meet Comorre, who
was approaching with a powerful army; but St Gildas
went into Triphyna&rsquo;s oratory and begged her to save
bloodshed and consent to the marriage. He gave her
a silver ring, which would warn her of any intended evil
by turning as black as a crow&rsquo;s wing at the approach of
danger.</p>
<p>The marriage took place with great rejoicings. The
first day six thousand guests were invited; on the next
day as many poor were fed, the bride and the bridegroom
themselves serving at the tables. For some time all
went well. Comorre&rsquo;s nature seemed altered; his
prisons were empty, his gibbets untenanted. But
Triphyna felt no confidence, and every day went to
pray at the tombs of his four wives. At this time
there was an assembly of the Breton princes at Rennes,
which Comorre was obliged to attend. Before his
departure he gave Triphyna his keys, desiring her
to amuse herself in his absence. After five months
he unexpectedly returned, and found her occupied
trimming an infant&rsquo;s cap with gold lace. On seeing
the cap Comorre turned pale; and when Triphyna
joyfully announced to him that soon he would be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
father he drew back in a rage and rushed out of the
apartment. Triphyna saw that her ring had turned
black, which betokened danger, she knew not why.
She descended into the chapel to pray. When she
rose to depart the hour of midnight struck, and suddenly
a sound of movement in the silent chapel chilled her at
the heart; shrinking into a recess, she saw the four
tombs of Comorre&rsquo;s wives open slowly, and the women
all issued forth in their winding-sheets.</p>
<p>Faint with terror, Triphyna tried to escape; but the
spectres cried: &ldquo;Take care, poor lost one! Comorre
seeks to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said the Countess. &ldquo;What evil have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told him that you will soon become a
mother; and, through the Spirit of Evil, he knows
that his child will slay him. He murdered us when we
told him what he has just learned from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hope, then, of refuge remains for me?&rdquo; cried
Triphyna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your father,&rdquo; answered the phantoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how escape when Comorre&rsquo;s dog guards the court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him this poison which killed me,&rdquo; said the first wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I descend yon high wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By means of this cord which strangled me,&rdquo; answered
the second wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who will guide me through the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire that burnt me,&rdquo; replied the third wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how can I make so long a journey?&rdquo; returned
Triphyna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this stick which broke my skull,&rdquo; rejoined the
fourth spectre.</p>
<p>Armed with the poison, the rope, and the stick, Triphyna
set out, silenced the dog, scaled the wall, and, miraculously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
guided on her way through the darkness by a
glowing light, proceeded on her road to Vannes. On
awaking next morning Comorre found that his wife had
fled, and pursued her on horseback. The poor fugitive,
seeing her ring turn black, turned off the road and hid
herself till night in the cabin of a shepherd, where there
was only an old magpie in a cage at the door, and here
her baby was born. Comorre, who had given up the
pursuit, was returning home by that road, when he
heard the magpie trying to imitate her complaints and
calling out &ldquo;Poor Triphyna!&rdquo; Guessing that his wife
had passed that way, he set his dog on the track.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Triphyna felt she could proceed no farther,
and lay down on the ground with her baby boy. As
she clasped the child in her arms she saw over her head
a falcon with a golden collar, which she recognized as
her father&rsquo;s. The bird came at her call, and giving it
the warning ring of St Gildas she told it to fly with it
to her father. The bird obeyed, and flew like lightning
to Vannes; but almost at the same instant Comorre
arrived. Having parted with her warning ring, Triphyna,
who had no notice of his approach, had only time to
conceal her babe in the cavity of a tree when Comorre
threw himself upon her, and with one blow from his
sword severed her head from her body.</p>
<p>When the falcon arrived at Vannes he found the Count
at dinner with St Gildas. He let the ring fall into the
silver cup of his master, who, recognizing it, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter is in danger! Saddle the horses, and
let Saint Gildas accompany us.&rdquo; Following the falcon,
they soon reached the spot where Triphyna lay dead.
After they had all knelt in prayer, St Gildas said to the
corpse: &ldquo;Arise, take thy head and thy child, and follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
us.&rdquo; The dead body obeyed, the bewildered troop
followed; but, gallop as fast as they could, the headless
body was always in front, carrying the babe in her left
hand, and her pale head in the right. In this manner
they reached the castle of Comorre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count,&rdquo; called St Gildas before the gates, &ldquo;I bring
back thy wife such as thy wickedness has made her, and
thy child such as heaven has given it thee. Wilt thou
receive them under thy roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comorre was silent. The Saint three times repeated
the question, but no voice returned an answer. Then
St Gildas took the new-born infant from its mother and
placed it on the ground. The child marched alone to
the edge of the moat, picked up a handful of earth, and,
throwing it against the castle, exclaimed: &ldquo;Let the
Trinity execute judgment.&rdquo; At the same instant the
towers shook and fell with a crash, the walls yawned
open, and the castle sunk, burying Comorre and all his
partners in crime. St Gildas then replaced Triphyna&rsquo;s
head upon her shoulders, laid his hands upon her, and
restored her to life, to the great joy of her father. Such
is the history of Triphyna and Comorre.</p>
<h3><i>The Legend of Ys</i></h3>
<p>The legend of the submerged city of Ys, or Is, is perhaps
the most romantic and imaginative effort of Breton
popular legend. Who has not heard of the submerged
bells of Ys, and who has not heard them ring in the
echoes of his own imagination?</p>
<p>This picturesque legend<a name='FNanchor_0042' id='FNanchor_0042'></a><a href='#Footnote_0042' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a> tells us that in the early days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
of the Christian epoch the city of Ys, or Ker-is, was
ruled by a prince called Gradlon, surnamed Meur,
which in Celtic means &lsquo;the Great.&rsquo; Gradlon was a
saintly and pious man, and acted as patron to GwÃ©nnolÃ©,
founder and first abbÃ© of the first monastery built in
Armorica. But, besides being a religious man, Gradlon
was a prudent prince, and defended his capital of Ys
from the invasions of the sea by constructing an
immense basin to receive the overflow of the water at
high tide. This basin had a secret gate, of which the
King alone possessed the key, and which he opened and
closed at the necessary times.</p>
<p>Gradlon, as is so often the case with pious men, had a
wayward child, the princess Dahut, who on one occasion
while her father was sleeping gave a secret banquet to
her lover, in which the pair, excited with wine, committed
folly after folly, until at last it occurred to the
frivolous girl to open the sluice-gate. Stealing noiselessly
into her sleeping father&rsquo;s chamber she detached
from his girdle the key he guarded so jealously and
opened the gate. The water immediately rushed in
and submerged the entire city.</p>
<p>But, as usual, there is more than one version of this interesting
legend. The city of Ys, says another account,
was a place rich in commerce and the arts, but so given
over to luxury as to arouse the ire of St GwÃ©nnolÃ©, who,
in the manner of Jeremiah, foretold its ruin. It was
situated where now a piece of water, the Ãtang de
Laval, washes the desolate shores of the Bay of
TrÃ©passÃ©s&mdash;though another version of the tale has it
that it stood in the vast basin which now forms the Bay
of Douarnenez. A strong dike protected it from the
ocean, the sluices only admitting sufficient water for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
needs of the town. Gradlon constantly bore round his
neck a silver key which opened at the same time the
vast sluices and the city gates. He lived in great state
in a palace of marble, cedar, and gold, and his only grief
was the conduct of his daughter Dahut, who, it is said,
&ldquo;had made a crown of her vices and taken for her
pages the seven capital sins.&rdquo; But retribution was at
hand, and the wicked city met with sudden destruction,
for one night Dahut stole the silver key for the purpose
of opening the city gates to admit her lover, and in the
darkness by mistake opened the sluices. King Gradlon
was awakened by St GwÃ©nnolÃ©, who commanded him
to flee, as the torrent was reaching the palace. He
mounted his horse, and, taking his worthless daughter
behind him, set off at a gallop, the incoming flood
seething and boiling at his steed&rsquo;s fetlocks. The torrent
was about to overtake and submerge him when a voice
from behind called out: &ldquo;Throw the demon thou carriest
into the sea, if thou dost not desire to perish.&rdquo; Dahut
at that moment fell from the horse&rsquo;s back into the water,
and the torrent immediately stopped its course. Gradlon
reached Quimper safe and sound, but nothing is said as
to his subsequent career.</p>

<p class='caption'>
THE ESCAPE OF KING GRADLON FROM THE FLOODED CITY OF YS<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>An ancient ballad on the subject, which, however, bears
marks of having been tampered with, states, on the
other hand, that Gradlon led his people into extravagances
of every kind, and that Dahut received the
key from him, the misuse of which precipitated the
catastrophe. Dahut, the ballad continues, became a
mermaid and haunted the waters which roll over the
site of the city where she loved and feasted. &ldquo;Fisherman,&rdquo;
ends the ballad, &ldquo;have you seen the daughter
of the sea combing her golden hair in the midday sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
at the fringes of the beach?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replies the
fisherman, &ldquo;I have seen the white daughter of the sea,
and I have heard her sing, and her songs were plaintive
as the sound of the waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legend of Ys, of the town swallowed up by the sea,
is common to the several branches of the Celtic race. In
Wales the site of the submerged city is in Cardigan Bay,
and in Ireland it is Lough Neagh, as Tom Moore says:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>On Lough Neagh&rsquo;s bank as the fisherman strays,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When the clear, cold eve&rsquo;s declining,</p>
<p>He sees the round towers of other days</p>
<p class='indent2'>In the wave beneath him shining.</p>
</div></div>
<p>This legend had its rise in an extraordinary story which
was given currency to by Giraldus Cambrensis in his
<i>Topography of Ireland</i>, to the effect that a certain extremely
wicked tribe were punished for their sins by the
inundation of their territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was a common proverb,&rdquo; says Gerald, &ldquo;in
the mouths of the tribe, that whenever the well-spring
of that country was left uncovered (for out of reverence
shown to it, from a barbarous superstition, the spring
was kept covered and sealed), it would immediately
overflow and inundate the whole province, drowning
and destroying the whole population. It happened,
however, on some occasion that a young woman, who
had come to the spring to draw water, after filling her
pitcher, but before she had closed the well, ran in great
haste to her little boy, whom she had heard crying at a
spot not far from the spring where she had left him. But
the voice of the people is the voice of God; and on her
way back she met such a flood of water from the spring
that it swept off her and the boy, and the inundation
was so violent that they both, and the whole tribe, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
their cattle, were drowned in an hour in this partial
and local deluge. The waters, having covered the
whole surface of that fertile district, were converted
into a permanent lake. A not improbable confirmation
of this occurrence is found in the fact that the fishermen
in that lake see distinctly under the water, in calm
weather, ecclesiastical towers, which, according to the
custom of the country, are slender and lofty, and moreover
round; and they frequently point them out to
strangers travelling through these parts, who wonder
what could have caused such a catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Welsh version of this fascinating legend it is
the bard Gwyddno, of the twelfth century, who tells of
the downfall of the submerged city, and two of the
strophes which occur in his poem are also found in
the Breton poem. The Welsh bard may have received
the story from Breton sources, or the converse may be
the case.</p>
<p>The legend that Cardigan Bay contains a submerged
territory is widely known, and strangely enough seems
to be corroborated by the shape of the coast-line, the
contour of which suggests the subsidence of a large
body of land. Like their brothers of Ireland, the
fishermen of Wales assert that at low tide they can
see the ruins of ancient edifices far down beneath the
clear waters of the bay.<a name='FNanchor_0043' id='FNanchor_0043'></a><a href='#Footnote_0043' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a></p>
<p>Before the days of the French Revolution there was
still to be seen at Quimper, between the two towers of
the cathedral, a figure of King Gradlon mounted on his
faithful courser, but in the stormy year of 1793 the name
of king was in bad odour and the ignorant populace
deprived the statue of its head. However, in 1859 it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
was restored. Legend attributes the introduction of the
vine into Brittany to King Gradlon, and on St Cecilia&rsquo;s
Day a regular ritual was gone through in Quimper
in connexion with his counterfeit presentment. A company
of singers mounted on a platform. While they
sang a hymn in praise of King Gradlon, one of the
choristers, provided with a flagon of wine, a napkin,
and a golden hanap (or cup), mounted on the crupper
of the King&rsquo;s horse, poured out a cup of wine, which
he offered ceremoniously to the lips of the statue and
then drank himself, carefully wiped with his napkin the
moustache of the King, placed a branch of laurel in his
hand, and then threw down the hanap in the midst of
the crowd below, in honour of the first planter of the
grape in Brittany. To whoever caught the cup before
it fell, and presented it uninjured to the Chapter, was
adjudged a prize of two hundred crowns.</p>
<p>There is a distinct savour of myth about all this. Can
it be that Gradlon was a Breton Bacchus? There are
notices of Celtic goddesses in whose honour Bacchic
rites were held, and the place of these was sometimes
taken by a corn god. Later the festival in its memorial
aspect appears to have been associated with different
kings<a name='FNanchor_0044' id='FNanchor_0044'></a><a href='#Footnote_0044' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a> in the various parts of the Celtic world, and it
seems likely that Gradlon was such a monarch who had
taken the place of a vanished deity. It must be left to
Celtic scholars to determine whether the name Gradlon
possesses any deific significance hidden in its etymology.</p>
<h3><i>The Clerk of Rohan</i></h3>
<p>Jeanne de Rohan, daughter of Alain, fifth of the name,
Viscount of Rohan, married in the year 1236 Matthew,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Seigneur of Beauvau, son of RenÃ©, Constable of Naples.
Breton popular poetry has in many ballads recounted
the adventures of Jeanne and her husband, one of which
is as follows<a name='FNanchor_0045' id='FNanchor_0045'></a><a href='#Footnote_0045' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a>:</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen Jeanne consented to be married,
but she desired that she herself should be allowed to
choose her husband. Accordingly the cavaliers and
barons of the district were invited to pay their court to
her, and she fixed her affections upon the Seigneur of
Beauvau, a valiant noble with large possessions in Italy.
He was loyal and courteous, and when the pair were
wedded their happiness seemed perfect.</p>
<p>At this period the war in Palestine against the infidels
was agitating the whole of Europe. The Seigneur of
Beauvau desired to join the Crusaders, but his wife was
by no means anxious that he should leave his home.
But his principle was <i>noblesse oblige</i>. &ldquo;I am of the
most noble blood,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;therefore it behoves me
to be the first to lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He confided the care of his estates and his affairs in
general to his wife&rsquo;s cousin, who was known as the
Clerk of Rohan, and begged him to look well after
Jeanne and his little son. Then, having bid farewell
to them all, he mounted his horse and rode away to
the wars.</p>
<p>Jeanne was inconsolable. For days she wandered
about the chÃ¢teau carrying her baby boy in her arms
and sobbing. All the domestic circle seemed disturbed
at the Seigneur&rsquo;s departure except the Clerk of Rohan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
to whom Count Matthew had so trustingly confided the
charge of his affairs.</p>
<p>The Seigneur had declared that he would return within
a year&rsquo;s time. A year passed, however, and no news of
him had been received. Now the Clerk was a perfidious
and wicked schemer, and one morning as he and
Jeanne were in conversation he hinted that the year
within which the Seigneur had promised to return was
now gone by and that the war in which he had been
engaged had come to an end. He made no secret
of his passion for the lady, but she on her part
turned upon him angrily, saying: &ldquo;Is it the fashion
nowadays for women to consider themselves widows,
knowing well that their husbands are alive? Go to,
miserable Clerk, thy heart is full of wickedness. If
my husband were here he would break thee in little
pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Clerk heard this he went secretly to the
kennels, and there he slew the Seigneur&rsquo;s favourite
greyhound. Taking some of its blood, he wrote with
it a letter to Count Matthew telling him that his wife
was most unhappy because of an accident which had
occurred; that she had been hunting the deer, and that
in the chase his favourite greyhound had died from
over-exertion. The Seigneur duly received the letter,
and in his reply told the Clerk to comfort the lady, as he
was quite able to replace the hound. At the same time
he desired that hunting should cease for the present,
as the huntsmen seemed unskilful in their conduct of
the chase.</p>
<p>The wicked Clerk once more sought the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are losing your beauty by weeping
night and day.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I will know how to recover my beauty when my
husband returns,&rdquo; she replied coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not cheat yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Surely you can
see by this time that he is either dead or has taken
another wife. In the East there are many beautiful
girls who are far wealthier than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has taken another wife,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I shall
die; and if he be dead I ask for naught but death.
Leave me, miserable wretch. Thy tongue is poisoned
with deceit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Clerk had sufficiently recovered from this
second rebuff, he betook himself to the stables, where
the Seigneur&rsquo;s horse, the most beautiful in the country,
stood champing in its stall. The wretch, drawing his
poignard, thrust it into the noble steed&rsquo;s entrails, and,
as he had done in the case of the greyhound, took
some of the blood and wrote once more to the Count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another accident has occurred at the chÃ¢teau,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but, my dear Seigneur, pray do not trouble
yourself on account of it. When your wife was returning
from a feast in the night your favourite horse fell
and broke two of his legs, and had to be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Seigneur replied that he was grieved to hear of
the circumstance, and that in order to avoid further
mischances of the sort it would be better that his wife
should frequent no more feasts.</p>
<p>A third time the perfidious Clerk sought the lady.
On this occasion he threatened her with death if she
would not be his, but she replied in the most spirited
manner that she loved death a thousand times better
than him. At these words he could not contain his
rage, and, drawing his dagger, thrust fiercely at her
head. But the lady&rsquo;s guardian angel turned the stroke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
and the weapon struck harmlessly against the wall.
She fled from the room, closing the door behind her
as she went; whereupon the Clerk rushed downstairs
to the nursery where her child was quietly sleeping in
its cradle, and, seeing no one beside it, stabbed the
slumbering infant to the heart.</p>
<p>Then he wrote to the Seigneur: &ldquo;Hasten your return,
I beg of you, for it is necessary that you should be here
to establish order. Your dog and your white courser
have perished, but that is not the worst. Your little son,
alas! is also dead. The great sow devoured him
when your wife was at a ball with the miller for a
gallant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Seigneur received this letter he returned at
once from the wars, his anger rising higher and higher
with every homeward league. When he arrived at the
chÃ¢teau he struck three times upon the door with his
hand, and his summons was answered by the Clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, evil Clerk,&rdquo; shouted the infuriated Count,
&ldquo;did I not leave my wife in your care?&rdquo; and with these
words he thrust his lance into the Clerk&rsquo;s open mouth,
so that the point stood out at the nape of his neck.
Then, mounting the stairs, he entered his wife&rsquo;s
chamber, and without speaking a word stabbed her with
his sword.</p>
<p>The ballad then goes on to speak of the burial of
the victims of the wicked Clerk. The lady, dressed
all in white, was laid in her tomb by the light of the
moon and the stars. On her breast lay her little son,
on her right the favourite greyhound, and on her left
the white courser, and it is said that in her grave she
first caresses one and then the other, and the infant, as
if jealous, nestles closer to his mother&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<h3><i>The Lady of La Garaye</i></h3>
<p>The chÃ¢teau of La Garaye, near Dinan, is rendered
famous by the virtues and boundless charity of its Count,
Claude Toussaint Marot de La Garaye, and his wife.
Their interesting story is told in the charming poem of
Mrs Norton, <i>The Lady of La Garaye</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Listen to the tale I tell,</p>
<p>Grave the story is&mdash;not sad;</p>
<p>And the peasant plodding by</p>
<p>Greets the place with kindly eye,</p>
<p>For the inmates that it had.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Count Claude de La Garaye and his wife were young,
beautiful, and endowed with friends, riches, and all that
could make life bright and happy. They entertained
generously and enjoyed the pleasures and amusements
of the world. But one day misfortune overtook them,
for the Countess was thrown from her horse, and she
was left a cripple for life, while all expectations of an
heir vanished. Both were inconsolable at their disappointment.
One day a monk came to visit them, and
tried to comfort them, seeking by his conversation to
turn their thoughts from earthly afflictions to heavenly
consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my father,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;how happy are you,
to love nothing on earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; answered the monk; &ldquo;I love all
those who are in sorrow or suffering. But I submit
myself to the will of the Almighty, and bend myself
with resignation to every blow He strikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded to show them that there was still a great
deal of happiness in store for them in ministering to the
needs of others. Following his counsel, they went to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
Paris, where for three years the Count studied medicine
and surgery, and his wife became a skilful oculist. On
their return to La Garaye they gave up all the amusements
of society and devoted themselves to relieving
the sufferings of their fellow-creatures. Their house
was converted into a hospital for the sick and afflicted,
under the ministering care of the Count and his benevolent
wife:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Her home is made their home; her wealth their dole;</p>
<p>Her busy courtyard hears no more the roll</p>
<p>Of gilded vehicles, or pawing steeds,</p>
<p>But feeble steps of those whose bitter needs</p>
<p>Are their sole passport. Through that gateway press</p>
<p>All varying forms of sickness and distress,</p>
<p>And many a poor, worn face that hath not smiled</p>
<p>For years, and many a feeble crippled child,</p>
<p>Blesses the tall white portal where they stand,</p>
<p>And the dear Lady of the liberal hand.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Nor was their philanthropy confined to their own
province. In 1729 they offered themselves to M. de
Belsunce&mdash;&ldquo;Marseilles&rsquo; good bishop&rdquo;&mdash;to assist him
during the visitation of the plague. The fame of their
virtues reached even the French Court, and Louis XV
sent Count de La Garaye the Order of St Lazarus, with
a donation of 50,000 livres and a promise of 25,000 more.
They both died at an advanced age, within two years
of each other, and were buried among their poor at
Taden. Their marble mausoleum in the church was
destroyed during the French Revolution. The Count
left a large sum to be distributed among the prisoners,
principally English, pent up in the crowded gaols of
Rennes and Dinan. He had attended the English
prisoners at Dinan during a contagious fever called the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
&lsquo;peste blanche,&rsquo; and in acknowledgment of his humanity
Queen Caroline sent him two dogs with silver collars
round their necks, and an English nobleman made him
a present of six more.</p>
<p>The ruined chÃ¢teau is approached by an ivy-covered
gateway, through an avenue of beeches. As Mrs
Norton renders it:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>And like a mourner&rsquo;s mantle, with sad grace,</p>
<p>Waves the dark ivy, hiding half the door</p>
<p>And threshold, where the weary traveller&rsquo;s foot</p>
<p>Shall never find a courteous welcome more.</p>
</div></div>
<p>The ruin is fast falling to pieces. The principal part
remaining is an octagonal turret of three stories, with
elegant Renaissance decoration round the windows.</p>
<h3><i>The Falcon</i></h3>
<p>An interesting and picturesque ballad sung in the Black
Mountains is that of <i>The Falcon</i>. Geoffrey, first Duke
of Brittany, was departing for Rome in the year 1008,
leaving the government of the country in the hands of
his wife Ethwije, sister of Richard of Normandy. As
he was about to set out on his pilgrimage the falcon
which he carried on his wrist after the manner of the
nobles of the period, swooped down on and killed the
hen of a poor peasant woman. The woman in a rage
seized a large stone and cast it at the bird with such
violence that it slew not only the falcon but the Duke
himself. The death of the Duke was followed by a
most desperate insurrection among the people. History
does not enlighten us as to the cause of this rising, but
tradition attributes it to the invasion of Brittany by the
Normans (whom the widow of Geoffrey at once brought
into the country on the demise of her husband) and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
exactions which were wrung from the peasants by these
haughty aliens.</p>

<p class='caption'>
A PEASANT INSURRECTION<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The ballad, which was used as a war-song by the
Bretons at a later day, begins in true ballad style:
&ldquo;The falcon has strangled the fowl, the peasant woman
has slain the Count who oppressed the people, the poor
people, like a brute-beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hate of the stranger so characteristic of the old
Bretons then flashes forth. &ldquo;The country has been
polluted by the foreigner, by the men of the Gallic
land, and because of the death of a hen and a falcon
Brittany is on fire, blood flows, and there is great dole
among the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the summit of the Black Mountain thirty stout
peasants had gathered to celebrate the ancient feast
of the good St John. Among them was Kado the
Striver, who stood there gravely leaning on his iron
pitchfork. For a while he looked upon his comrades;
then he opened his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you, fellow-peasants? Do you intend to
pay this tax? As for me, I shall certainly not pay it.
I had much rather be hanged. Nevermore shall I pay
this unjust tax. My sons go naked because of it, my
flocks grow less and less. No more shall I pay. I
swear it by the red brands of this fire, by Saint Kado
my patron, and by Saint John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fortunes are broken, I am completely ruined,&rdquo;
growled one of his companions. &ldquo;Before the year is
out I shall be compelled to beg my bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all rose at once as if by a common impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us will pay this tax! We swear it by the
Sun and by the Moon, and by the great sea which
encircles this land of Brittany!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Kado, stepping out from the circle, seized a firebrand,
and holding it aloft cried: &ldquo;Let us march, comrades,
and strike a blow for freedom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of his companions burst out afresh.
Falling into loose ranks they followed him. His
wife marched by his side in the first rank, carrying
a reaping-hook on her shoulder and singing as she
marched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly, quickly, my children! We go to strike a
blow for liberty! Have I brought thirty sons into the
world to beg their bread, to carry firewood or to break
stones, or bear burdens like beasts? Are they to
till the green land and the grey land with bare feet
while the rich feed their horses, their hunting-dogs,
and their falcons better than they are fed? No! It
is to slay the oppressors that I have borne so many
sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly they descended the mountains, gathering
numbers as they went. Now they were three thousand
strong, five thousand strong, and when they arrived at
Langoad nine thousand strong. When they came to
GuÃ©rande they were thirty thousand strong. The
houses of those who had ground them down were
wrapped in flames, fiercely ends the old ballad, &ldquo;and
the bones of those who had oppressed them cracked,
like those of the damned in Tartarus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>History tells us nothing concerning Kado the Striver,
but it is most unlikely that he is a mere figment of
popular imagination. What history does record,
however, is that the wicked Duchess and her host
of mercenary Normans were forced to flee, and that
her place was taken by a more just and righteous
ruler.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<h3><i>The Marquis of GuÃ©rande</i></h3>
<p>Breton tradition speaks of a wild young nobleman,
Louis-FranÃ§ois de GuÃ©rande, Seigneur of Locmaria,
who flourished in the early part of the seventeenth
century. He was wealthy, and lived a life of reckless
abandon; indeed, he was the terror of the parish and
the despair of his pious mother, who, whenever he
sallied forth upon adventure bent, rang the bell of the
chÃ¢teau, to give the alarm to the surrounding peasantry.
The ballad which tells of the infamous deeds of this titled
ruffian, and which was composed by one Tugdual SalaÃ¼n,
a peasant of Plouber,<a name='FNanchor_0046' id='FNanchor_0046'></a><a href='#Footnote_0046' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> opens upon a scene of touching
domestic happiness. The Clerk of Garlon was on a
visit to the family of his betrothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, good mother,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;where is AnnaÃ¯k?
I am anxious that she should come with me to dance on
the green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is upstairs asleep, my son. Take care,&rdquo; added
the old woman roguishly, &ldquo;that you do not waken
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Clerk of Garlon ran lightly up the staircase and
knocked at AnnaÃ¯k&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, AnnaÃ¯k,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;why are you asleep when
all the others go to dance upon the village green?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to go to the dance, for I fear the
Marquis of GuÃ©rande,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>The Clerk of Garlon laughed. &ldquo;The Marquis of
GuÃ©rande cannot harm you so long as I am with you,&rdquo;
he said lightly. &ldquo;Come, AnnaÃ¯k; were there a hundred
such as he I should protect you from them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>Reassured by her lover&rsquo;s brave words, the girl rose and
put on her dress of white delaine. They were a joyous
and beautiful pair. The Clerk was gaily dressed, with
a peacock&rsquo;s feather in his hat and a chain on his breast,
while his betrothed wore a velvet corsage embroidered
with silver.</p>
<p>On that evening the Marquis of GuÃ©rande leaped on
his great red steed and sallied forth from his chÃ¢teau.
Galloping along the road, he overtook the Clerk of
Garlon and his betrothed on their way to the dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you go to the dance, I see. It is
customary to wrestle there, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Seigneur,&rdquo; replied the Clerk, doffing his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then throw off your doublet and let us try a fall or
two,&rdquo; said GuÃ©rande, with a wicked look at AnnaÃ¯k
which was not lost upon her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving your grace, I may not wrestle with you,&rdquo; said
the Clerk, &ldquo;for you are a gentleman and I am nobody.
You are the son of a lord and I am the son of a
peasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! what! The son of a peasant, say you, and you
take your choice of the pretty girls of the village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seigneur, pardon me. I did not choose this maiden;
God gave her to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this parley AnnaÃ¯k stood by, trembling violently.
She had heard of the Marquis of GuÃ©rande, and was
only too well aware of the evil and reckless character
he bore. The Clerk tried to calm her fears by whispered
words and pressures of the hand, but the wicked Marquis,
observing the state of terror she was in, exulted in the
alarm he was causing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since you cannot wrestle with
me perhaps you will try a bout of sword-play.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>At these words AnnaÃ¯k&rsquo;s rosy cheeks became deathly
white; but the Clerk of Garlon spoke up like a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not wear a sword. The
club is my only weapon. Should you use your sword
against me it would but stain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wicked Marquis uttered a fiendish laugh. &ldquo;If I
stain my sword, by the Saints, I shall wash it in your
blood,&rdquo; he cried, and as he spoke he passed his rapier
through the defenceless Clerk&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>At the sight of her slain lover the gentle heart of AnnaÃ¯k
broke, and a great madness came upon her. Like a
tigress she leapt upon the Marquis and tore his sword
from his hand. Without his rapier he was as a child
in the grasp of the powerful Breton peasant woman.
Exerting all her strength, in a frenzy of grief she
dragged the wretch to the green where the dance was
in progress, haling him round and round it until
exhausted. At last she dropped his senseless body on
the green turf and hastened homeward.</p>
<p>And once again we encounter the haunting refrain:
&ldquo;My good mother, if you love me make my bed, for I
am sick unto death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, daughter, you have danced too much; it is that
which has made you sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not danced at all, mother; but the wicked
Marquis has slain my poor Clerk. Say to the sexton
who buries him: &lsquo;Do not throw in much earth, for in
a little while you will have to place my daughter beside
him in this grave.&rsquo; Since we may not share the same
marriage-bed we shall at least sleep in the same tomb,
and if we have not been married in this world we shall
at least be joined in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader will be relieved to learn that the hero of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
this ballad, the Clerk of Garlon, was not killed after all,
and that for once fact is enabled to step in to correct
the sadness of fiction; for, when one comes to think of
it, there are few sadder things in the world than the
genuine folk-ballad, which, although at the time it may
arouse &aelig;sthetic emotions, may yet afterward give
rise to haunting pain. We are glad to be able to
chronicle, then, that the worthy Clerk did not die of
his wound as stated by Tugdual SalaÃ¼n of the parish
of Plouber, author of the ballad, and that the wicked
Marquis escaped the halter, which, according to Breton
custom, he would not otherwise have done had the Clerk
died. His good mother took upon herself the burden
of an annual pension to the Clerk&rsquo;s aged parents, and
adopted the second child of AnnaÃ¯k, who had duly married
her sweetheart, and this little one she educated, furthering
its interests in every possible manner. As for the
Marquis, he actually settled down, and one cannot help
feeling chagrined that such a promising rogue should
have turned talents so eminently suitable for the manufacture
of legendary material into more humdrum courses.
Conscious of the gravity of his early misdemeanours, he
founded a hospital for the poor of the parish, and each
evening in one of the windows of this place the peasants
could see a light which burned steadily far into the
night. If any asked the reason for this illumination he
was told: &ldquo;It is the Marquis of GuÃ©rande, who lies
awake praying God to pardon his youth.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>The ChÃ¢teaux of Brittany</i></h3>
<p>The chÃ¢teaux of Brittany may truly be called the
historical and legendary shrines of the province, for
within their halls, keeps, and donjons Breton tradition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
and history were made. It is doubtful, indeed, if the
castellated mansions of any other country, save, perhaps,
those of the Rhine, harbour so many legends, arising
either from the actual historical happenings connected
with them or from those more picturesque yet terrible
associations which they are popularly supposed to have
with the powers of evil. The general appearance of
such a building as the Breton chÃ¢teau admirably lends
itself to sombre tradition. The massy walls seem thick
enough to retain all secrets, and the cry for vengeance
for blood spilt within them cannot pass to the outer
world through the narrow <i>meurtriÃ¨res</i> or arrow-slits of
the <i>avant-corps</i>. The broad yet lofty towers which flank
the front rise into a <i>toiture</i> or <i>coiffe</i> like an enchanter&rsquo;s
conical cap. The <i>lucarnes</i>, or attic casements, are
guarded on either side by gargoyles grim of aspect, or
perhaps by griffins holding the shield-borne arms of dead
and gone seigneurs. Seek where you will, among the
wizard-houses of old Prague, the witch-dens of ancient
Edinburgh, the bat-haunted castles of Drachenfels or
Rheinstein, you will come at nothing built of man more
informed with the soul of the Middle Ages, more
drenched with their peculiar savour of mystery, than
these stark keeps whose crests and <i>girouettes</i> rise
above encircling woods or frown upon mirroring rivers
over the length and breadth of the Breton land.</p>
<h3><i>La Roche-Jagu</i></h3>
<p>One of the most typical of the chÃ¢teaux of Brittany is
that of La Roche-Jagu, at one time the guardian of the
mouth of the river Trieux. It is built on the top of a
hill which overhangs the Trieux, and from one of its
battlemented galleries a splendid view of the windings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
of the river can be obtained. The wall on this side of
the fortress is so thick as to allow of a chapel being
hewn out of its solidity. A most distinctive architectural
note is struck by the fourteen wonderful chimney-shafts
of cut stone ornamented with iron spikes.</p>
<h3><i>TonquÃ©dec</i></h3>
<p>Some miles farther down the river, but on its opposite
side, is the imposing castle of TonquÃ©dec, perhaps the
finest remnant of the medieval military architecture of
Brittany. It has always remained in the family of the
Viscounts of CoÃªtman, who ranked among the foremost
of the Breton nobility, though one of them espoused the
cause of the Constable Clisson against Duke John IV,
and had the anguish of seeing his ancestral fortress
razed to the ground. Under Henry IV, however, the
castle was restored, only to be again demolished by
order of Cardinal Richelieu, who strongly and forcibly
disapproved of such powerful fortalices.</p>
<p>It had an outer enclosure, and had to be entered by
a drawbridge, and it was strengthened in every way
conceivable to the military art of the times. It was
surrounded by dwellings for the convenience of the
seigneur&rsquo;s retainers, a fine <i>salle d&rsquo;armes</i> still remaining.
To the keep, four stories high, a flying bridge led, in
order to facilitate the withdrawal of the garrison in case
of siege. Behind walls ten feet thick, so long as food
and ammunition lasted, the inmates could hold the
enemy in scorn.</p>
<h3><i>Clisson</i></h3>
<p>The chÃ¢teau of Clisson, once the property of the great
Constable Oliver de Clisson, whom the Viscount of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
CoÃªtman and the Bretons of PenthiÃ¨vre had championed,
is now only a grand old ruin, a touching monument
of the architectural splendours of former days. By
moonlight it makes a scene not easily forgotten, gaunt
and still and ruggedly imposing, the silent reminder of
events and people tales of whom will not readily die,
the treasurer of secrets it will probably never yield.
Its antithesis is the castle of Nantes, with the stamp
of the Renaissance upon its delicately sculptured
balconies and window-frames. It is now an arsenal,
a fact which robs it of some of the romantic interest
of Clisson, or, indeed, of ruins in general, yet within its
walls are the prison chambers in which Gilles de Laval,
the ambitious Finance Minister Fouquet, the Cardinal
de Retz, and the Duchess of Berry once languished.
For many years it served as one of the political prisons
of France, though it is also associated with brighter
and happier times; for here, on pleasure bent, lingered
many of the Kings of France from Louis XI onward,
and here in 1675 Madame de SÃ©vignÃ© sojourned, a circumstance
which casts about it a literary as well as a
romantic glamour. The great well in the courtyard,
with its ornamental railing of wrought iron, is quite
equal to the famous well of Quentin Matsys at Antwerp.</p>
<h3><i>Josselin</i></h3>
<p>The castle of Josselin, also associated with the history
of the great Constable Clisson and his allies, as well
as with the notorious League whose followers wrought
such intolerable misery in Brittany, is built on a rocky
foundation near the river Oust. With its imposing
front and conically roofed towers it is one of the best
examples of a twelfth-century fortress-chÃ¢teau. Very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
different in tone is the architecture of the interior court,
being that of the period when the lighter traceries and
more imaginative lines of the Renaissance were in
favour. The window-openings of the two first stories
are beautiful enough to rival those of Chambord and
equal those of Blois. Above the windows an open
gallery runs, and in the space between each the device
of the Rohans is carved, with their motto, <i>A Plus</i>, this
celebrated family having built this part of the chÃ¢teau.
About the year 1400 Clisson added a keep, walls, and
parapets, but in 1629, when the fortress was no longer
a stronghold of the League, these were permitted to
fall into ruin. Through the courtesy of the family
now in residence this wonderfully preserved castle
may be visited, a circumstance for which the tourist in
Brittany should indeed be grateful. Interest within
these massy walls clings around the well, with its
ornamental railings, the noble and lofty hall, the library,
with its magnificent chimney-piece, repeating again, in
stone, the Rohan motto, <i>A Plus</i>, and the equestrian
statue of Clisson, by FrÃ©miet, in the dining-room.</p>
<h3><i>Hennebont and Largoet</i></h3>
<p>Of the old chÃ¢teau of Hennebont, where John of Montfort
breathed his last after escaping from the Louvre
of his day, only a heap of stones remains. The old
fortress of Largoet is in much the same condition,
nothing of the ancient structure having been conserved
save the famous Tour d&rsquo;Elven, considered to be the most
beautiful castle keep in all Brittany, which has also
a literary distinction as being the scene of some of
the most touching episodes in Octave <a name='TC_3'></a><ins title="Added apostrophe">Feuillet&rsquo;s</ins> <i>Roman
d&rsquo;un jeune Homme pauvre</i>.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<h3><i>ChÃ¢teaubriant</i></h3>
<p>At ChÃ¢teaubriant, which owes its name to the compounding
of the word &lsquo;chÃ¢teau&rsquo; with that of &lsquo;Briant,&rsquo; the
family style of its original lord, the old feudal fortress
is now a ruin, but the castle, built by Jean de Laval,
Governor of Brittany under Francis I, is in good repair.
An inscription giving the date of the completion of
the new chÃ¢teau as 1538 is above the portal of the
colonnade. There is a gruesome legend associated
with the old chÃ¢teau, in which for some time
dwelt the unfortunate FranÃ§oise de Foix, Countess of
ChÃ¢teaubriant and beloved of Francis I. Tiring or
becoming suspicious of her royal lover, she decided to
return to her husband, the old Count of Laval. The
reunion, however, was not productive of happiness,
owing to the fever of jealousy in which her elderly
husband lived because of the love affair with the King.
This jealousy eventually flared into mania when he
heard that she had actually visited her former lover
in prison after he had been captured at Pavia. Instantly
he &ldquo;shut his young wife up in a darkened and
padded cell, and finally had her cut into pieces by
two surgeons,&rdquo; so the story goes. Terrified at what
he had done and of the consequences which were sure
to follow when the King heard of his savagery, the
Count fled the country immediately afterward.</p>
<p>The chÃ¢teau of Brodineuf (dating from the twelfth
century) and that of Caradeuc are in good repair,
but the latter is ancient only in parts. It shelters two
Murillos within its walls. The picturesque chÃ¢teau of
Combourg was in early times a feudal fortress, and in it
RenÃ© ChÃ¢teaubriand&rsquo;s infancy was passed. This place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
may be visited by interested sightseers, and there they
may view the writing-table of the author of <i>Le GÃ©nie
du Christianisme</i>, and, in the bedroom he occupied at
Combourg, the bed on which he died in Paris. The
chÃ¢teau of VitrÃ© is also in a state of preservation, and
is considered one of the best specimens of military
architecture in the province. Comparatively near is the
chÃ¢teau of Rochers, once the home of Mme de SÃ©vignÃ©,
and in consequence one of the famous sights of the
country. The many letters she dated from this castle
paint a vivid and detailed picture of social life in the
seventeenth century, and fortunately the atmosphere
of the time has been happily retained in the building
itself.</p>
<p>Another twelfth-century structure is that of the chÃ¢teau
of Rustefan, near QuimperlÃ©. It was built by Stephen,
Count of PenthiÃ¨vre, and belonged in the next century
to Blanche of Castile, the mother of St Louis.
The ruins now in existence are those of the chÃ¢teau
built in the fifteenth century, and its cylindrical tower,
pinnacled doorway, and the stone mullions of the
windows still remain fairly intact. The chÃ¢teau of
Kerjolet, in Concarneau, is one which has been saved
from decay, restored as it was by Countess Chaveau-Narishkine
and presented by her to the department. It
contains a museum in which are specimens of all the
costumes and <i>coiffes</i> of Lower Brittany, and antiquities
of prehistoric and medieval times, which all students of
Breton and Celtic lore should see.</p>
<h3><i>Palaces of the Past</i></h3>
<p>The chÃ¢teau of Tourlaville is situated among very
beautiful surroundings, and is built in the classic style
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
of the Renaissance, with an angular tower. On
chimney-piece and fireplace throughout the castle there
are numerous sentimental devices in which Cupids and
flaming hearts and torches figure largely, with the
occasional accompaniment of verses and mottoes of
an equally amatory nature. These are all seventeenth-century
examples and may be taken as expressions of the
time. In a boudoir called the Blue Chamber, because
of the colour of its draperies and decorations, many
coats-of-arms are emblazoned; but all the greatness to
which these testify has become a thing of the past, for
the chÃ¢teau has now been turned into a farmhouse.</p>
<p>The chÃ¢teau of Dinan may also be classed among the
palaces of the past, for now, despite the fact that it
was built by the Dukes of Brittany, it has become a
prison. From the tourist as well as the romantic point
of view this is somewhat of a tragedy. The Tower
of CoÃ«tquen, one of the ancient towers of the city
wall, is practically part of the castle, and the keep,
or Queen Anne&rsquo;s Tower, is the most distinctive feature
remaining. This keep is of four stories, and is over a
hundred feet high, the last story being reached by a
spiral staircase. What was once the oratory of the
Duchess Anne is now the guard-room. There are still
several dungeons whose original gruesomeness has been
left untouched, and whose use in bygone days can well
be imagined.</p>
<h3><i>Suscino</i></h3>
<p>The chÃ¢teau of Suscino is one of the chief sights of the
neighbourhood of Vannes, because it is the ruin of what
was once a marvellous structure of the thirteenth century,
and follows the finest Gothic traditions of the time. All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the roofing of the building has quite disappeared, but
its battlemented towers and walls remain to give a
good idea of the architectural perfection that must have
belonged to it. At one time it fell into the hands of
Charles of Blois, only to be retaken by his rival,
Montfort, in 1364, and in 1373 it was occupied by an
English garrison. Eventually it was bestowed upon
John of ChÃ¢lons, Prince of Orange, by Anne of Brittany,
but in time Francis I relieved him of it in order to
present it to FranÃ§oise de Foix, the celebrated Lady of
ChÃ¢teaubriant. The irregular pentagon formed by the
chÃ¢teau is possibly somewhat modified from the original
plan of 1320, and of the seven towers which flanked its
gates and walls in the beginning six have weathered the
storms of the times through which they have passed.
Its orchid-shaped machicolations have also survived, and
even to-day they are noticeably beautiful. The new
tower is a fine cylindrical keep, dating from the fourteenth
century, and over the entrance this legend still remains:</p>

<p>We have already dealt with many of the stories connected
with the ancient castles of Brittany, and these will be
found in nearly every chapter of this book, so varied are
they. But no tale, however vivid, can hope to capture
and retain all the wonder and mystery of these grand
old strongholds, which must be seen in order to leave
upon the imagination and memory the full impress of
their weird and extraordinary fascination.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII: HERO-TALES OF BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Soon</span> after the Vicomte Hersart de la VillemarquÃ©
published his <i>Barzaz-Breiz</i>, a collection of popular
ballads from the Breton, critics who possessed a
knowledge of the language and were acquainted with
its literature exposed the true nature of the work, acting,
indeed, as did British critics when Macpherson
published his fragments of Ossian. VillemarquÃ© was,
in fact, a Breton Macpherson. He would hear a Breton
ballad sung or recited, and would then either enlarge
upon it and torture it out of all resemblance to its
original shape, or he would instigate a literary friend to
do so. We must remember that such a proceeding was
fashionable at the time, as no less a personage than
Sir Walter Scott had led the way, and he had been
preceded by Burns in the practice. But whereas Burns
made no secret of what he did and greatly enhanced the
poetical value of the songs and ballads he altered, Scott
and his friends, Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Leyden, and others,
indulged in what they described as the &ldquo;mystification&rdquo;
of their acquaintances by these semi-forgeries. Like
theirs, VillemarquÃ©&rsquo;s work had usually an historical or
legendary basis, but it is impossible to say how much of
it is original matter of folk-song and how much his own
invention, unless we compare his versions with those
furnished by M. Luzel in his <i>Guerziou Breiz-Izel</i>
(1868), which, however, only contains a few of the
originals of the tales given in the <i>Barzaz-Breiz</i>, and
those not the most interesting.</p>
<p>I have cast the following tales into narrative form from
the ballads published in the <i>Barzaz-Breiz</i>, where they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
obviously appear as traditional tales in a polished,
modern dress.<a name='FNanchor_0047' id='FNanchor_0047'></a><a href='#Footnote_0047' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a> They may be regarded, largely, as efforts
of the modern imagination regarding the Breton past.
In any case the author of a book on Breton romances
would not be justified in omitting all mention of
VillemarquÃ© and refraining from affording the reader a
specimen of his work, any more than he would be in
founding solely upon the labours of the Vicomte.</p>
<h3><i>Lez-Breiz, the Prop of Brittany</i></h3>
<p>Morvan, chief of LÃ©on, so celebrated in the history of
the ninth century as one of the upholders of Breton
independence, and known to tradition as &lsquo;the Prop of
Brittany,&rsquo; is the subject of a remarkable series of ballads
or hero-tales in the <i>Barzaz-Breiz</i> which together constitute
what is almost an epic. These tell of his life,
death, adventures, travels, and the marvellous feats of
derring-do he accomplished. In some measure he is
to Breton legend what Arthur is to British or Holger
to that of Denmark. That he is familiar to Breton
tradition there can be no question, and whether
VillemarquÃ© himself wove the following adventures
around him or not they are certainly typical of the age
in which the hero flourished.</p>
<h3><i>Morvan&rsquo;s First Adventure</i></h3>
<p>One day the child Morvan was sitting at the edge
of the forest when a cavalier issued from its depths
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
armed at all points and riding a great charger. The
boy, excited by his martial appearance, ran from
him in terror, calling out that here indeed was
St Michael; but the cavalier rode so swiftly that he
soon came up with the lad, who devoutly threw himself
on his knees and made the sign of the Cross, calling
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seigneur Saint Michael, in the name of God I pray
thee do me no harm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight laughed loudly. &ldquo;Why, lad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
am no more Saint Michael than I am a thief, but merely
a belted knight, such as one may meet with by the
score in this land of chivalry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen a knight,&rdquo; replied Morvan; &ldquo;and
what may that be which you carry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is called a lance, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are these that you wear on your head and
breast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one is a casque and the other a breast-plate.
They are intended to protect me from the stroke of
sword and spear. But tell me, lad, have you seen any
one pass this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Seigneur, a man went by this very road not
half an hour agone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, boy,&rdquo; replied the knight. &ldquo;If you are asked
who spoke to you, say the Count of Quimper,&rdquo; and with
these words he spurred his horse and set off down
the road in the direction which the little Morvan had
indicated.</p>
<p>Morvan returned to his mother, who had been sitting
some distance away, and began to tell her of his meeting.
He was so full of the gallantry of the knight he had
met, his grace and martial bearing, that the good dame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
could not stem the torrent of words which flowed
from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; he babbled on, &ldquo;you never saw anyone
so splendid as him whom I have seen to-day, a man
more beautiful than the Lord Michael the Archangel,
whose image is in our church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother smiled and patted him fondly on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my son,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no man so beautiful
as the Archangel Michael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But little Morvan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving your grace, there are, my mother,&rdquo; he said
gravely. &ldquo;There are many men more splendid than
Saint Michael, and they are called knights. How I
wish that I might grow up and become a knight too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the poor lady, who had lost her
husband in battle and who dreaded that her only son
might be taken from her, was seized with such dismay
that she sank to the ground unconscious. The little
Morvan, without turning his head, entered the stables
and led out a fresh horse. Jumping lightly on the
steed&rsquo;s back, he turned its head in the direction in
which the splendid cavalier had gone and rode hastily
after him.</p>
<h3><i>The Return of Morvan</i></h3>
<p>Ten years passed&mdash;years full of martial achievement
and adventure for young Morvan. Then a desire to
return to the ancestral mansion seized upon the youth,
and he made his way homeward. But great was his
dismay when he entered the courtyard of the manor
and looked about him, for the blackberry bushes and
the nettles were growing round the threshold of the
house and the walls were half ruined and covered with
ivy. As he was about to enter he observed a poor old
blind woman standing in the entrance.</p>

MORVAN RETURNS TO HIS RUINED HOME<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, dame, but perhaps you can give me
hospitality for the night,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! sir, we have but little,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;This
house has been allowed to go to ruin since its son and
heir quitted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she ceased speaking a young damsel descended the
broken stone steps, and after regarding Morvan for a
moment burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, maiden,&rdquo; said Morvan, &ldquo;wherefore do
you weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Seigneur,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;I have a
brother who left us ten years ago to lead the life of
a warrior, and every time that I see a youth about his
age I feel myself compelled to weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, my child,&rdquo; said Morvan, &ldquo;have you no other
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None in the world, Sir Knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother, what of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! sir, she too is gone. There is no one but
myself and my old nurse in the house. My poor
mother died of grief when my brother rode off to become
a knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words Morvan was deeply affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wretch that I am, I have slain her
who gave me birth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he spoke thus the damsel turned deadly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of heaven, sir, who are you?&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;How are you named?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Morvan, son of Conan, and Lez-Breiz is my
surname, my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl stared for a moment, sighed, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
fell into his arms; but soon she opened her eyes and
praised God that she had found her long-lost brother.</p>
<h3><i>The King&rsquo;s Cavalier</i></h3>
<p>But Lez-Breiz could not remain long at home. The
tented field was his fireside, the battle his sport.
Adventure followed adventure in his full and stirring
life. One day he said to his young squire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arouse you, my squire, and furnish my sword, my
casque, and my shield, that I may redden them in the
blood of the Franks, for with the help of God and
this right arm I shall carry slaughter into their ranks
this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, my lord,&rdquo; asked the squire, &ldquo;shall I not fight
along with you to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morvan smiled at the lad&rsquo;s eagerness, perhaps because
he remembered his own on the day he met the
Count of Quimper, then a grave shadow crossed his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of your mother, lad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What if you
never return to her? Think of her grief should you
die this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Seigneur,&rdquo; entreated the stripling, &ldquo;if you love
me, grant my prayer; let me fight along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Morvan rode out to battle an hour later his
squire rode beside him, knee to knee. Passing near
the church of St Anne of Armor they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Saint Anne, most holy dame,&rdquo; prayed Morvan, &ldquo;I
am not yet twenty years old and I have been in twenty
battles. All those I have gained by your aid, and if I
return again to this land I shall make you a rich gift. I
shall give you enough candles to go three times round the
walls of your church, and thrice round your churchyard&mdash;aye,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
thrice round your lands, when I come home again;
and further I shall give you a banner of white satin with
an ivory staff. Also shall I give you seven silver bells
which will ring gaily night and day above your head.
And three times on my knees will I draw water for
your use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enemy saw Morvan coming from afar. He was
mounted on a small white ass with a halter of hemp, to
signify his contempt for them. Lorgnez, his chief foe,
came against him with a troop of warriors, while Morvan
had only his little squire behind him. The foemen came
on, ten by ten, until they reached the Wood of Chestnuts.
For a moment the little squire was dismayed, but a word
from his master rallied him, and, drawing his sword, he
spurred forward. Soon they came front to front with
Lorgnez and hailed him in knightly fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Seigneur Lorgnez, good day to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morrow, Seigneur Morvan. Will you engage in
single combat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I despise your offer. Go back to your King and
tell him that I mock him; and as for yourself, I laugh
at you and those with you. Return to Paris, stay
among your women, take off your mail and put on
the silken armour of fops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorgnez&rsquo;s face flamed with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the lowest varlet in my
company shall hew your casque from your head for
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Morvan drew his great sword.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The old hermit of the wood heard some one knocking
on the door of his cell. He opened it quickly and saw
the young squire standing before him. He started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
back at the sight of the youth&rsquo;s blood-stained armour
and death-pale countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, my son,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are sorely hurt. Come
and wash your wounds at the fountain and repose for a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not rest here, good father,&rdquo; replied the squire,
shaking his head. &ldquo;I have come to find water to take
to my young master, who has fallen in the fight. Thirty
warriors lie slain by his hand. Of these the Chevalier
Lorgnez was the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave youth!&rdquo; said the hermit. &ldquo;Alas that he has
fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not grieve, father. It is true that he has fallen,
but it is only from fatigue. He is unwounded and will
soon recover himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was recovered Morvan betook him to the
chapel of St Anne and rendered the gifts he had
promised her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise be to Saint Anne,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;for she it is who
has gained this victory.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>The King&rsquo;s Blackamoor</i></h3>
<p>One day the King of the Franks was sitting among his
courtiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that some one would rid me of this pestilent
Morvan, who constantly afflicts the Frankish land and
slays my doughtiest warriors,&rdquo; he said, on hearing of a
fresh exploit on the part of the Breton chief.</p>
<p>Then the King&rsquo;s blackamoor, who heard these words,
arose and stood before his master. He was tall and
great of thew and sinew&mdash;a giant among men, towering
head and shoulders even above the tall Frankish
warriors.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to fulfil your wishes, sire,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sir
Morvan has sent me his glove, and if to-morrow I do
not bring you his head I will willingly part with
my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the next morning Morvan&rsquo;s squire came to his
master trembling violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seigneur,&rdquo; he said, with ashy countenance, &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s
Moor is here and bids you defiance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morvan rose and took his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my dear master,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;take heed
what you do, I pray you, for I assure you that this Moor
is nothing but a demon who practises the most horrible
enchantments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morvan laughed. &ldquo;Well, we shall see whether this
demon can withstand cold steel or not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go
and saddle my black horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving your grace,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;if you will
hearken to my words you will not fight on the black
charger. He has been bewitched. Moreover, you will
notice that when you enter the lists to fight the Moor
he will cast his mantle to the ground. But do not
follow his example, for should your mantle fall beneath
his the strength of the black giant will be doubled.
When the Moor advances to the attack make the sign
of the Cross with the shaft of your lance, and when he
rushes upon you in his battle-fury receive him with the
steel. If you do this you may be sure that your lance
will not break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heroes met within the lists. The King of France
and his nobles had followed the giant Moor in order
to witness the combat, and when all had been seated
the trumpets sounded and the two champions rushed
together with the utmost fury. They circled round one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
another like eagles seeking an opening to strike. Now
one struck, then the other, and the blood flowed down
their bright armour. The Frankish King in high
excitement called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! black crow of the sea, pierce me now this merle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the giant assailed Morvan most furiously,
as a great tempest assails a ship. The lances crossed,
but that of the Moor broke like matchwood. Both
leaped to earth, sword in hand, and rushed at each
other like lions. Many lusty strokes were given and
taken, and from their armour flew sparks like those
from a smith&rsquo;s anvil. Then the Moor, grasping his
sword with both hands, made ready to strike a mighty
blow, when swift and trenchantly Morvan thrust
his blade far into the arm-pit and the heart and
the giant tumbled to the earth like a falling tree.
Morvan placed his foot on the dead man&rsquo;s breast, withdrew
his sword, and cut off the Moor&rsquo;s head. Then,
attaching the bleeding trophy to the pommel of his
saddle, he rode home with it and affixed it to the gate
of his castle. All men praised him for his doughty deed,
but he gave the grace of his victory entirely to St Anne,
and declared that he would build a house of prayer in
her honour on the heights between LÃ©guer and the
Guindy.</p>
<h3><i>Morvan Fights the King</i></h3>
<p>One day Morvan sallied forth to encounter the King of
the Franks himself. The King brought no fewer than
five thousand mounted men-at-arms. As this host was
about to set out, a great clap of thunder resounded in
the vault of heaven, and the King&rsquo;s nobles perforce
regarded it as a bad omen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, sire, go not hence,&rdquo; said one of
them, &ldquo;since the day has begun with such an evil
token.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; was the royal reply. &ldquo;I have given the
order; we must march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That morning, on the other hand, the sister of Morvan
said to her brother: &ldquo;My dear brother, if you love me
seek not this combat, for if you do you will certainly go
to your death, and what will become of me afterward?
I see on the shore the white sea-horse, the symbol of
Brittany. A monstrous serpent entwines him, seizing
him round the hind legs and the body with his enormous
coils. The sea-steed turns his head to seize the reptile.
The combat is unequal. You are alone; the Franks
are legion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Morvan was already beyond ear-shot.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As the hermit of the wood of HellÃ©an<a name='FNanchor_0048' id='FNanchor_0048'></a><a href='#Footnote_0048' class='fnanchor'>[48]</a> slept three
knocks sounded on his door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good hermit,&rdquo; said some one, &ldquo;open the door. I seek
an asylum and help from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind blew coldly from the country of the Franks.
It was the hour when savage beasts wander here and
there in search of their prey. The hermit did not rise
with alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you who knock at my door at this hour of
night demanding an entrance?&rdquo; he asked sulkily;
&ldquo;and by what sign shall I know whether you are a true
man or otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priest, I am well known in this land. I am Morvan
Lez-Breiz, the Hatchet of Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not open my door to you,&rdquo; said the hermit hastily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
&ldquo;You are a rebel; you are the enemy of the good King
of the Franks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, priest!&rdquo; cried Morvan angrily, &ldquo;I am a Breton
and no traitor or rebel. It is the King of the Franks
who has been a traitor to this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, recreant!&rdquo; replied the hermit. &ldquo;Rail not
against the King of the Franks, for he is a man of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of God, say you? Nay, rather of the devil! Has he
not ravaged and wasted the Breton land? The gold
that he wrings from the Breton folk is expended for the
good of Satan. Open, hermit, open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, my son, for should I do so the Franks would
surely fix a quarrel upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo; shouted Morvan in a voice of thunder.
&ldquo;Good; then I shall burst into your cell,&rdquo; and with
these words he threw himself against the door, which
creaked ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, my son, hold!&rdquo; cried the old hermit in tremulous
tones. &ldquo;Forbear and I will open to you&rdquo;; and seizing
a torch he lit it at the remains of his fire and went to
open the door.</p>
<h3><i>The Severed Head</i></h3>
<p>He unlocked it and drew it back, but as he did so he
recoiled violently, for he saw advancing upon him a
terrible spectre, holding its head in its two hands. Its
eyes seemed full of blood and fire, and rolled round and
round in a most horrible manner. The hermit was
about to shriek in terror when the head of the apparition,
after laughing grimly, addressed him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, old Christian, do not be afraid. God
permits this thing to be. He has allowed the Franks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
to decapitate me, but for a time only, and as you see
me now I am only a phantom. But He will permit you
yourself to replace my head on my shoulders if you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hermit stammered and drew back. This was not
his first encounter with the supernatural, which he had
good reason to dread, but like all Bretons he had come
under the magnetism of Morvan, even although he
believed that the King of the Franks was his rightful
overlord; so, steeling himself against his natural
timidity, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God permits this thing I shall be very willing to
replace your head on your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it, then,&rdquo; said the decapitated Morvan, and with
trembling hands the priest took the gory trophy and
replaced it on the Breton chief&rsquo;s shoulders, saying at
the same time: &ldquo;I replace your head, my son, in the
name of God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by virtue of this benediction the phantom once
more became a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morvan,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;you must do penance, heavy
penance, with me. You must carry about with you for
seven years a robe of lead, padlocked to your neck, and
each day at the hour of twelve you must go to fetch
water from the well at the summit of the mountain
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do as you desire,&rdquo; said Morvan; &ldquo;I will follow
your saintly wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the seven years of the penance had passed the
robe had flayed Morvan&rsquo;s skin severely, and his beard,
which had become grey, and the hair of his head, fell
almost to his waist. Those who saw him did not
recognize him; but a lady dressed in white, who passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
through the greenwood, stopped and gazed earnestly at
him and her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morvan, my dear son, it is indeed you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Come here, my beloved child, that I may free you of
your burden,&rdquo; and she cut the chain which bound the
shirt of lead to the shoulders of the penitent with a pair
of golden scissors, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your patron, Saint Anne of Armor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now for seven years had the squire of Morvan sought
his master, and one day he was riding through the
greenwood of HellÃ©an.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what profits it that I have slain his
murderer when I have lost my dear lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he heard at the other end of the wood the plaintive
whinnying of a horse. His own steed sniffed the
air and replied, and then he saw between the parted
branches a great black charger, which he recognized as
that of Lez-Breiz. Once more the beast whinnied
mournfully. It almost seemed as if he wept. He was
standing upon his master&rsquo;s grave!</p>
<p>But, like Arthur and Barbarossa, Morvan Lez-Breiz
will yet return. Yes, one day he will return to fight
the Franks and drive them from the Breton land!</p>
<p>We have sundry intimations here of the sources from
which VillemarquÃ© drew a part at least of his matter.
There are resemblances to Arthurian and kindred
romances. For example, the incident which describes
the flight of young Morvan is identical with that in the
Arthurian saga of <i>Percival le Gallois</i>, where the child
Percival quits his mother&rsquo;s care in precisely the same
fashion. The Frankish monarch and his Court, too,
are distinctly drawn in the style of the <i>chansons de
gestes</i>, which celebrated the deeds of Charlemagne and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
his peers. There are also hints that the paganism
against which Charlemagne fought, that of the Moors
of Spain, had attracted the attention of the author,
and this is especially seen in his introduction of the
Moorish giant, so common a figure in the Carlovingian
stories.</p>
<h3><i>The Ballad of Bran</i></h3>
<p>A sorrowful and touching ballad, claimed by VillemarquÃ©
as being sung in the Breton dialect of LÃ©on, tells of the
warrior Bran, who was wounded in the great fight of
Kerlouan, a village situated on the coast of LÃ©on, in the
tenth century. The coast was raided by the Norsemen,
and the Bretons, led by their chief, Even the Great,
marched against them and succeeded in repelling them.
The Norsemen, however, carried off several prisoners,
among them a warrior called Bran. Indeed, a village
called Kervran, or &lsquo;the village of Bran,&rsquo; still exists
near the seashore, and here it was, tradition relates,
that the warrior was wounded and taken by the
Scandinavian pirates. In the church of Goulven is to
be seen an ancient tablet representing the Norse vessels
which raided the coast.</p>
<p>The ballad recounts how Bran, on finding himself on
the enemy&rsquo;s ship, wept bitterly. On arriving in the
land of the Norsemen he was imprisoned in a tower,
where he begged his gaolers to allow him to send a
letter to his mother. Permission to do so was granted,
and a messenger was found. The prisoner advised this
man, for his better safety, to disguise himself in the habit
of a beggar, and gave him his gold ring in order that
his mother might know that the message came from her
son in very truth. He added: &ldquo;When you arrive in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
my country proceed at once to my mother, and if she
is willing to ransom me show a white sail on your
return, but if she refuses, hoist a black sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the messenger arrived at the warrior&rsquo;s home in the
country of LÃ©on the lady was at supper with her family
and the bards were present playing on their harps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greeting, lady,&rdquo; said the messenger. &ldquo;Behold the
ring of your son, Bran, and here is news from him contained
in this letter, which I pray you read quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady took the missive, and, turning to the harpers,
told them to cease playing. Having perused the letter
she became extremely agitated, and, rising with tears
in her eyes, gave orders that a vessel should be
equipped immediately so that she might sail to seek her
son on the morrow.</p>
<p>One morning Bran, the prisoner, called from his tower:
&ldquo;Sentinel, Sentinel, tell me, do you see a sail on the
sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the sentinel, &ldquo;I see nothing but the sea
and the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At midday Bran repeated the question, but was told
that nothing but the birds and the billows were in sight.
When the shadows of evening gathered he asked once
more, and the perfidious sentinel replied with a lie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lord, there is a ship close at hand, beaten by
wind and sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what colour of a sail does she show?&rdquo; asked Bran.
&ldquo;Is it black or white?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is black, lord,&rdquo; replied the sentinel, in a spirit of
petty spite.</p>
<p>When the unhappy warrior heard these words he never
spoke more.</p>
<p>That night his mother arrived at the town where he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
had been imprisoned. She asked of the people:
&ldquo;Why do the bells sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! lady,&rdquo; said an ancient man, &ldquo;a noble prisoner
who lay in yonder tower died this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With bent head the lady walked to the tower, her white
hair falling upon her folded arms. When she arrived
at its foot she said to the guard: &ldquo;Open the door
quickly; I have come to see my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the great door was opened she threw herself
upon the corpse of Bran and breathed her last.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On the battlefield of Kerlouan there is an oak which
overshadows the shore and which marks the place
where the Norsemen fled before the face of Even the
Great. On this oak, whose leaves shine in the moon,
the birds gather each night, the birds of the sea and the
land, both of white and black feather. Among them is an
old grey rook and a young crow. The birds sing such a
beautiful song that the great sea keeps silence to hear
it. All of them sing except the rook and the crow.
Now the crow says: &ldquo;Sing, little birds, sing; sing, little
birds of the land, for when you die you will at least end
your days in <a name='TC_4'></a><ins title="Added quote">Brittany.&rdquo;</ins></p>
<p>The crow is of course Bran in disguise, for the name
Bran means &lsquo;crow&rsquo; in the Breton tongue, and the rook
is possibly his mother. In the most ancient Breton
traditions the dead are represented as returning to
earth in the form of birds. A number of the incidents
in this piece are paralleled in the poem of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>,
which also introduces a messenger who disguises himself
for the purpose of travelling more safely in a
foreign country, a ring of gold, which is used to
show the messenger&rsquo;s <i>bona-fides</i>, a perfidious gaoler,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
and the idea of the black or white sail. The original
poem of <i>Sir Tristrem</i> was probably composed about
the twelfth or thirteenth century, and it would seem
that the above incidents at least have a Breton source
behind them. A mother, however, has been substituted
for a lover, and the ancient Breton dame takes the
place of Ysonde. There is, indeed, little difference
between the passage which relates the arrival of the
mother in the Norsemen&rsquo;s country and that of Ysonde
in Brittany when she sails on her last voyage with
the intention of succouring Tristrem. Ysonde also
asks the people of the place why the bells are ringing,
one of the ancient inhabitants tells her of the death
of her lover, and, like the Breton mother, she casts
herself on the body of him she has lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This passage,&rdquo; says VillemarquÃ©, with wonderful <i>sang-froid</i>,
&ldquo;duly attests the prior claim of the Armorican
piece!&rdquo; But even if he had been serious, he wrote
without the possession of data for the precise fixing
of the period in which the Breton ballad was composed;
and in any case his contention cannot assist the Breton
argument for Armorican priority in Arthurian literature,
as borrowing in ballad and folk-tale is much more
flagrant than he, writing as he did in 1867, could ever
have guessed&mdash;more flagrant even than any adaptation
he himself ever perpetrated!</p>
<p>He adds, however, an antiquarian note to the poem
which is of far greater interest and probably of more
value than his supposition. He alludes to the passage
contained in the ballad regarding the harpers who are
represented as playing in the hall of Bran&rsquo;s mother
while she sits at supper. The harp, he states, is no
longer popular in Brittany, and he asks if this was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
always the case. There can be very little doubt that
in Brittany, as in other Celtic countries&mdash;for example,
Wales, Ireland and Scotland&mdash;the harp was in ancient
times one of the national instruments. It is strange
that it should have been replaced in that country
by the <i>biniou</i>, or bagpipe, just as the <i>clairschach</i>, or
Highland harp, was replaced by the same instrument
in the Highlands of Scotland.</p>
<h3><i>Fontenelle</i></h3>
<p>Guy Eder de Fontenelle, a son of the house of Beaumanoir,
was one of the most famous partisans of the
Catholic League, and, according to one who saw him
in 1587, had then begun to show tendencies to the wild
life he was afterward to lead. He was sent as a scholar
to Paris to the College of Boncotest, but in 1589, when
about sixteen years of age, he became impatient of
scholastic confinement, sold his books and his robe,
and bought a sword and poignard. Leaving the college,
he took the road to OrlÃ©ans, with the object of attaching
himself to the army of the Duke of Mayenne, chief
of the Catholic party in France, but, returning to his
native Brittany, he placed himself at the head of the
populace, which had risen in arms on behalf of the
Leaguers. As he was of good family and a Breton
and displayed an active spirit, they obeyed him very
willingly. Soon he translated his intentions into action,
and commenced to pillage the smaller towns and to
make captive those who differed from him politically.
He threatened Guingamp, which was held for the
King, and made a sally into LÃ©on, carrying away the
daughter of the Lady of Coadelan, a wealthy heiress,
who was only about eight or nine years of age. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
occurrence VillemarquÃ© has related for us in Breton
verse, assuring us that it was &lsquo;recovered&rsquo; by the Comte
de Kergariou, a friend of his. Fontenelle is supposed
to have encountered the little heiress plucking flowers
in a wayside ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, little one,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for whom do you pluck
these flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my foster-brother, whom I love. But I am afraid,
for I know that Fontenelle is near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, then, so you know this terrible Fontenelle, my
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I do not know him, but I have heard tell
of him. I have heard folk say that he is a very wicked
man and that he carries away young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fontenelle, with a laugh, &ldquo;and, above
all, heiresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the child in his arms and swung her on to
the crupper of his saddle. Then, dashing the spurs
into his charger&rsquo;s flanks, he set off at a gallop for Saint-Malo,
where he placed the little heiress in a convent,
with the object of marrying her when she had arrived
at the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>Years afterward Fontenelle and the heiress, who was
now his wife, went to live at their manor of Coadelan.
They had a little child beautiful as the day, who greatly
resembled his father. One day a letter arrived for
the Seigneur, calling upon him to betake himself to
Paris at once. His wife was inconsolable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not set forth alone for Paris, I pray you,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;for if you do I shall instantly follow you. Remain
at home, I beg of you, and I will send a messenger
in your stead. In the name of God, do not go, husband,
for if you do you will never return.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>But Fontenelle disregarded his wife&rsquo;s entreaties, and,
begging her to take good care of their son during his
absence, set forth on his journey to the capital. In
due time he arrived in Paris and stood before the
King and Queen. He greeted them courteously, but
they looked coldly on him, and the King told him
bluntly that he should not return to Coadelan, adding:
&ldquo;There are sufficient chains in my palace to restrain
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this Fontenelle called his little page and
begged him to return at once to his mistress and tell
her to discard her finery, because she would soon be
a widow, and to bring him back a coarse shirt and a
white sheet, and, moreover, to bring a gold plate on
which his enemies might expose his head after his
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, little page,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;take a lock of my hair
and place it on the door of Coadelan, so that all men as
they go to Mass may say, &lsquo;God have mercy on the soul
of Fontenelle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The page did as he was bidden, but as for the plate of
gold it was useless, for Fontenelle&rsquo;s head was thrown
on the pavement to serve as a ball for the children of
the gutter.</p>
<p>All Paris was surprised when one day a lady from a
distant country arrived and made great stir in its narrow
streets. Every one asked his neighbour who this dame
might be. It was the heiress of Coadelan, dressed in a
flowing robe of green. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the pitiful burgesses,
&ldquo;if she knew what we know she would be
dressed in black.&rdquo; Shortly she stood before the King.
&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;give me back my husband, I beg
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; replied the King, with feigned
sorrow, &ldquo;what you ask is impossible, for but three
days ago he was broken on the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoso goes to Coadelan to-day will turn away from it
with grief, for the ashes are black upon the hearth and
the nettles crowd around the doorway&mdash;and still,&rdquo; the
ballad ends naÃ¯vely, &ldquo;still the wicked world goes round
and the poor folk weep with anguish, and say, &lsquo;Alas
that she is dead, the mother of the poor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>The Return from England</i></h3>
<p>There is a good deal of evidence to show that a considerable
body of Bretons accompanied the invading
army of William the Conqueror when he set forth with the
idea of gaining the English crown. They were attached
to his second battle corps, and many of them received
land in England. A ballad which, says VillemarquÃ©,
bears every sign of antiquity deals with the fortunes of
a young Breton, Silvestik, who followed in the train
of the Conqueror. The piece is put into the mouth of
the mother of Silvestik, who mourns her son&rsquo;s absence,
and its tone is a tender and touching one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night as I lay on my bed,&rdquo; says the anxious
mother, &ldquo;I could not sleep. I heard the girls at
Kerlaz singing the song of my son. O God, Silvestik,
where are you now? Perhaps you are more than three
hundred leagues from here, cast on the great sea, and
the fishes feed upon your fair body. Perhaps you may
be married now to some Saxon damsel. You were to
have been wed to a lovely daughter of this land,
MannaÃ¯k de Pouldergat, and you might have been
among us surrounded by beautiful children, dwelling
happily in your own home.</p>

THE FINDING OF SILVESTIK<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken to my door a little white dove which
sits in a small hollow of the stone. I have tied to
his neck a letter with the ribbon of my wedding-dress
and have sent it to my son. Arise, my little dove,
arise on your two wings, fly far, very far across the
great sea, and discover if my son is still alive and
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvestik rested in the shade of an English wood, and
as he did so a familiar note fell upon his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sound resembles the voice of my mother&rsquo;s little
white dove,&rdquo; he said. The sound grew louder; it
seemed to say, &ldquo;Good luck to you, Silvestik, good luck
to you. I have here a letter for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvestik in high happiness read the letter, and resolved
to return home to his sorrowing parent.</p>
<p>Two years passed, three years passed, and the dove
did not return to delight the heart of the longing mother,
who day by day walked the dismal seashore waiting
for the vessel that never came. One day of storm she
was wandering on the beach as usual when she saw
a vessel being driven with great force upon the iron
coast. Even as she watched it it dashed upon the rocks.
Soon there were cast upon the shore the forms of many
dead, and when the gale abated and the heart-sick mother
was able to search among them she found Silvestik!</p>
<p>Several competent judges are of opinion that this
ballad is contemporary with the events which it relates.
Many of the Breton lords who sailed with William the
Conqueror did not return for several years after the
expedition had accomplished its object, and some not
at all. Nothing is known regarding the hero. The
bird is frequently the messenger between lovers in
ballad literature, but it is seldom that it is found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
carrying letters between a mother and her son&mdash;indeed,
this is perhaps the only instance known.</p>
<h3><i>The Marriage-Girdle</i></h3>
<p>This ballad has reference to the Breton expedition
which sailed for Wales in 1405 to assist the Welsh
under Owen Glendower to free their principality from
the English yoke. The Bretons rendered material
assistance to their Welsh brothers, and had the satisfaction
on their return of knowing that they had
accomplished that which no French king had ever
been able to achieve&mdash;the invasion of English territory.
The expedition was commanded by Jean de Rieux,
Marshal of France, and numbered ten thousand
men.</p>
<p>The ballad tells how a young man on the morning after
his betrothal received orders to join the standard of
de Rieux &ldquo;to help the Bretons oversea.&rdquo; It was with
bitterness in his heart, says the lover, that he entered
the house of his betrothed with the object of bidding
her farewell. He told her that duty called him, and
that he must go to serve in England. At this her tears
gushed forth, and she begged him not to go, reminding
him how changeful was the wind and how perfidious
the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you die what shall I do? In my
impatience to have news of you my heart will break. I
shall wander by the seashore, from one cottage to another,
asking the sailors if they have heard tell of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be comforted, AloÃ¯da,&rdquo; said her lover, &ldquo;and do not
weep on my account. I will send you a girdle from
over the sea, a girdle of purple set with rubies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted at daybreak, he to embark on the sea, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
to weep, and as he sought his ship he could hear the
magpies cackle: &ldquo;If the sea is changeable women are
even more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the autumn had arrived the young girl said: &ldquo;I
have looked far over the sea from the heights of the
mountains of Arez. I have seen upon the waters a
ship in danger, and I feel that upon it was him whom I
love. He held a sword in his hand, he was engaged in
a terrible combat, he was wounded to death and his
garments were covered with blood. I am certain that
he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before many weeks had passed she was affianced
to another.</p>
<p>Then good news arrived in the land. The war was
finished and the cavalier returned to his home with a
gay heart. No sooner had he refreshed himself than
he went to seek his beloved. As he approached her
dwelling he heard the sound of music, and observed
that every window in the house was illuminated as if
for a festival. He asked some revellers whom he met
outside the cause of this merrymaking, and was told
that a wedding was proceeding.</p>
<p>It is the custom in Brittany to invite beggars to a
wedding, and when these were now admitted one of
them asked hospitality for the night. This was at once
granted him, but he sat apart, sad and silent. The
bride, observing this, approached him and asked him
why he did not join in the feasting. He replied that
he was weary with travel and that his heart was heavy
with sorrow. Desirous that the marriage festivities
should not flag, the bride asked him to join her in the
dance, and he accepted the invitation, saying, however,
that it was an honour he did not merit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>Now while they danced he came close to her and
murmured in her ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with the golden ring that you
received from me at the door of this very house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bride stared at him in wild dismay. &ldquo;Oh, heaven,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;behold, I have now two husbands! I who
thought I was a widow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think wrongly, <i>ma belle</i>,&rdquo; hissed the beggar;
&ldquo;you will have no husband this side of the grave,&rdquo;
and drawing a dagger from under his cloak he struck
the lady to the heart.</p>
<p>In the abbey of Daoulas there is a statue of the Virgin
decorated with a splendid girdle of purple sparkling
with rubies, which came from across the sea. If you
desire to know who gave it to her, ask of a repentant
monk who lies prostrate on the grass before the figure
of the Mother of God.</p>
<p>It is strange that the faithless damsel should have
alleged that she saw her lover perish in a naval combat
when in the very year to which the circumstances of
the ballad refer (1405) a Breton fleet encountered and
defeated an English flotilla several leagues from Brest.
&ldquo;The combat was terrible,&rdquo; says a historian of the
Dukes of Burgundy, &ldquo;and was animated by the ancient
hate between the English and the Bretons.&rdquo; Perhaps
it was in this sea-fight that the lady beheld her lover;
and if, as she thought, he was slain, she scarcely
deserves the odium which the balladeer has cast upon
her memory.</p>
<h3><i>The Combat of Saint-Cast</i></h3>
<p>This ballad somewhat belies its name, for it has some
relation to an extraordinary incident which was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
means rather of preventing than precipitating a battle.
In 1758 a British army was landed upon the shores of
Brittany with the object of securing for British merchant
ships safety in the navigation of the Channel and of
creating a diversion in favour of the German forces,
then our allies. A company of men from Lower
Brittany, from the towns of TrÃ©guier and Saint-Pol-de-LÃ©on,
says VillemarquÃ©, were marching against a
detachment of Scottish Highlanders. When at a
distance of about a mile the Bretons could hear their
enemies singing a national song. At once they halted
stupefied, for the air was one well known to them,
which they were accustomed to hear almost every
day of their lives. Electrified by the music, which
spoke to their hearts, they arose in their enthusiasm
and themselves sang the patriotic refrain. It was the
Highlanders&rsquo; turn to be silent. All this time the two
companies were nearing one another, and when at a
suitable distance their respective officers commanded
them to fire; but the orders were given, says the
tradition, &ldquo;in the same language,&rdquo; and the soldiers on
both sides stood stock-still. Their inaction, however,
lasted but a moment, for emotion carried away all
discipline, the arms fell from their hands, and the
descendants of the ancient Celts renewed on the field
of battle those ties of brotherhood which had once united
their fathers.</p>
<p>However unlikely this incident may seem, it appears to
be confirmed by tradition, if not by history. The air
which the rival Celts sang is, says VillemarquÃ©,<a name='FNanchor_0049' id='FNanchor_0049'></a><a href='#Footnote_0049' class='fnanchor'>[49]</a> common
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
to both Brittany and &ldquo;the Highlands of Scotland.&rdquo;
With the music before me, it seems to bear a marked
resemblance to The <i>Garb of Old Gaul</i>, composed by
General Reid (1721-1807). Perhaps Reid, who was a
Highlander, based his stirring march on an older Celtic
theme common to both lands.</p>
<h3><i>The Song of the Pilot</i></h3>
<p>One of the most famous of Breton nautical traditions
tells of the chivalry displayed by a Breton crew
toward the men of a British warship. During the
American War of Independence much enthusiasm
was excited in France in connexion with the valiant
struggle for liberty in which the American colonies were
engaged. A number of Breton ships received letters of
marque enabling them to fight on the American side
against Great Britain, and these attempted to blockade
British commerce. The <i>Surveillante</i>, a Breton vessel
commanded by CouÃ©dic de Kergoaler, encountered the
British ship <i>Quebec</i>, commanded by Captain Farmer.
In the course of the action the <i>Surveillante</i> was nearly
sunk by the British cannonade and the <i>Quebec</i> went
on fire. But Breton and Briton, laying aside their
swords, worked together with such goodwill that most
of the British crew were rescued and the <i>Surveillante</i>
was saved, although the <i>Quebec</i> was lost, and this
notwithstanding that nearly every man of both crews
had been wounded in the fighting.</p>
<p>I have here attempted a very free translation of the
stirring ballad which relates this noteworthy incident,
which cannot but be of interest at such a time as the
present.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX: THE BLACK ART AND ITS MINISTERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Sorcery</span> is a very present power in most isolated
communities, and in the civilized portions of
Brittany it is but a thing of yesterday, while in
the more secluded departments it is very much a thing
of to-day. The old folk can recall the time when the
farm, the dairy, and the field were ever in peril of the
spell, the enchantment, the noxious beam of the evil
eye, and tales of many a &ldquo;devilish cantrip sleight,&rdquo; as
Burns happily characterized the activity of the witch
and the wizard, were told in hushed voices at the Breton
fireside when the winter wind blew cold from the cruel
sea and the heaped faggots sent the red glow of fire-warmth
athwart the thick shadows of the great farm
kitchen, and old and young from grandsire to herd-boy
made a great circle to hearken to the creepy tales so
dear to the Breton heart.</p>
<p>As in the East, where to refuse baksheesh is to lay
oneself open to the curse of the evil eye, the beggar
was regarded as the chief possessor of this bespelling
member. The guild of tattered wanderers naturally
nourished this superstition, and to permit one of its
members to hobble off muttering threats or curses was
looked upon as suicidal. Indeed, the mendicants were
wont to boast of their feats of sorcery to the terrified
peasants, who hastened to placate them by all the means
in their power.</p>
<p>Certain villages, too, appear to have possessed an evil
reputation among the country-folk as the dwelling-places
of magicians, centres of sorcery, which it was
advisable to shun. Thus we read in Breton proverb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
of the sorcerers of FougÃ¨res, of TrÃ¨ves, of Concoret,
of LÃ©zat.</p>
<p>The strangest circumstances were connected with the
phenomena of sorcery by the credulous Bretons.
Thus, did a peasant join a dance of witches, the sabots
he had on would be worn out in the course of the
merrymaking. A churn of turned butter, a sour pail
of milk, were certain to be accounted for by sorcery.
In a certain village of Moncontour the cows, the dog,
even the harmless, necessary cat, died off, and the
farmer hastened to consult a diviner, who advised him
to throw milk in the fire and recite certain prayers.
The farmer obeyed and the spell was broken!</p>
<p>In the town of Rennes about fifty years ago dwelt a
knowing fellow called Robert, a very &lsquo;witch-doctor,&rsquo;
who investigated cases of sorcery and undertook the
dissipation of enchantments. On a certain large farm
the milk would yield no butter. An agricultural expert
might have hinted at poor pasturage, but the farmer
and his wife had other views as to the cause of the
&lsquo;insufficiency of fats,&rsquo; as an analyst would say, in the
lacteal output of the establishment. Straightway they
betook themselves to the mysterious Robert, who
on arriving to investigate the affair was attired in a
skin dyed in two colours. He held in leash a large
black dog, evidently his familiar. He exorcized the
dairy, and went through a number of strange ceremonies.
Then, turning to the awestruck farm hands,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may now proceed with your work. The spell
is raised. It has been a slow business. I must go
now, but don&rsquo;t be afraid if you see anything odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he whistled, and a great black horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
at once appeared as if from nowhere. Placing his hand
on its crupper, he vaulted into the saddle, bade good-bye
to the astonished rustics, and while they gazed at him
open-mouthed, vanished &lsquo;like a flash.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many kinds of amulets or talismans were used by the
Breton peasantry to neutralize the power of sorcerers.
Thus, if a person carried a snake with him the enchanters
would be unable to harm his sight, and all
objects would appear to him under their natural forms.
Salt placed in various parts of a house guarded it
against the entrance of wizards and rendered their
spells void.</p>
<p>But many consulted the witch and the sorcerer for their
personal advantage, in affairs of the heart, to obtain a
number in the casting of lots for conscription which would
free them from military service, and so forth; and, as
in other countries, there grew up a class of middlemen
between the human and the supernatural who posed as
fortune-tellers, astrologers, and quack mediciners.</p>
<p>It was said that sorcerers were wont to meet at the
many Roches aux FÃ©es in Brittany at fixed periods in
order to deliberate as to their actions and settle their
affairs. If anyone, it was declared, wandered into their
circle or was caught by them listening to their secret
conclave he seldom lived long. Others, terrified at the
sight presented by the gleaming eyes of the cat-sorcerers,
blazing like live coals, fled incontinently from their
presence, and found that in the morning the hair of
their heads had turned white with the dread experience.
Long afterward they would sit by the fireside trembling
visibly at nothing, and when interrogated regarding
their very evident fears would only groan and bury their
faces in their hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>A story is told of one, Jean Foucault, who one moonlight
night had, like Tam o&rsquo; Shanter, sat overlong</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Fast by an ingle bleezin&rsquo; finely,</p>
<p>Wi&rsquo; reaming swats that drank divinely,</p>
</div></div>
<p>where the cider was as good as the company, and,
issuing at midnight&rsquo;s weary hour from his favourite inn,
was not in a mood to run away from anything, however
fearsome. Walking, or rather rolling, across the moor
singing the burden of the last catch he had trolled with
his fellows at the ale-house, all on a sudden he stumbled
into a circle of sorcerer-cats squatting around a cross of
stone. They were of immense size and of all colours,
black, grey, white, tortoise-shell, and when he beheld
them seated round the crucifix, their eyes darting fire
and the hair bristling on their backs, his song died
upon his lips and all his bellicose feelings, like those
of Bob Acres, leaked out at his finger-tips. On
catching sight of him the animals set up a horrible
caterwauling that made the blood freeze in his veins.
For an awful moment the angry cats glared at him
with death in their looks, and seemed as if about to
spring upon him. Giving himself up for lost, he closed
his eyes. But about his feet he could hear a strange
purring, and, glancing downward, he beheld his own
domestic puss fawning upon him with every sign of
affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass my master, Jean Foucault,&rdquo; said the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied a great grey tom, whom Jean took
to be the leader; &ldquo;pass on, Jean Foucault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jean, the cider fumes in his head quite dissipated,
staggered away, more dead than alive.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<h3><i>Druidic Magic</i></h3>
<p>The more ancient sorcerers of Brittany deserve a word
of notice. Magic among the Celtic peoples in olden
times was so clearly identified with Druidism that its
origin may be said to have been Druidic. Whether
Druidism was of Celtic origin, however, is a question
upon which much discussion has taken place, some
authorities, among them Rhys, believing it to have been
of non-Celtic and even non-Aryan origin, and holding
that the earliest non-Aryan or so-called Iberian people
of Britain introduced the Druidic religion to the immigrant
Celts. An argument advanced in favour of
this theory is that the Continental Celts sent their
neophyte Druid priests to Britain to undergo a special
training at the hands of the British Druids, and that
this island seems to have been regarded as the headquarters
of the cult. The people of Cisalpine Gaul, for
instance, had no Druidic priesthood. C&aelig;sar has told
us that in Gaul Druidic seminaries were very numerous,
and that within their walls severe study and discipline
were entailed upon the neophytes, whose principal business
was to commit to memory countless verses enshrining
Druidic knowledge and tradition. That this
instruction was astrological and magical we have the
fullest proof.<a name='FNanchor_0050' id='FNanchor_0050'></a><a href='#Footnote_0050' class='fnanchor'>[50]</a></p>
<p>The Druids were magi as they were priests in the same
sense that the American Indian shaman is both magus
and priest. That is, they were medicine-men on a
higher scale, and had reached a loftier stage of transcendental
knowledge than the priest-magicians of more
barbarous races. Thus they may be said to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
link between the barbarian shaman and the magus of
medieval times. Many of their practices were purely
shamanistic, while others more closely resembled
medieval magical rite. But they were not the only
magicians of the Celts, for frequently among that people
we find magic power the possession of women and of the
poetic craft. The magic of Druidism had many points
of comparison with most magical systems, and perhaps
approximated more to that black magic which desires
power for the sake of power alone than to any transcendental
type. Thus it included the power to render
the magician invisible, to change his bodily shape, to
produce an enchanted sleep, to induce lunacy, and to
inflict death from afar.</p>
<p>The arts of rain-making, bringing down fire from
heaven, and causing mists, snow-storms, and floods
were also claimed for the Druids. Many of the spells
probably in use among them survived until a comparatively
late period, and are still employed in some remote
Celtic localities, the names of saints being substituted
for those of Celtic deities. Certain primitive ritual, too,
is still carried out in the vicinity of some megalithic
structures in Celtic areas, as at Dungiven, in Ireland,
where pilgrims wash before a great stone in the river
Roe and then walk round it, and in many parts of
Brittany.<a name='FNanchor_0051' id='FNanchor_0051'></a><a href='#Footnote_0051' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a></p>
<p>In pronouncing incantations the usual method employed
was to stand upon one leg and to point with the
forefinger to the person or object on which the spell
was to be laid, at the same time closing one eye, as if
to concentrate the force of the entire personality upon
that which was to be placed under ban. A manuscript
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
possessed by the monastery of St Gall, and dating from
the eighth or ninth century, includes magical formul&aelig;
for the preservation of butter and the healing of certain
diseases in the name of the Irish god Diancecht. These
and others bear a close resemblance to Babylonian and
Etruscan spells, and thus go to strengthen the hypothesis
often put forward with more or less plausibility
that Druidism had an Eastern origin. At all magical
rites spells were uttered. Druids often accompanied an
army, to assist by their magical arts in confounding the
enemy.<a name='FNanchor_0052' id='FNanchor_0052'></a><a href='#Footnote_0052' class='fnanchor'>[52]</a></p>
<p>There is some proof that in Celtic areas survivals of
a Druidic priesthood have descended to our own time
in a more or less debased condition. Thus the existence
of guardians and keepers of wells said to possess magical
properties, and the fact that in certain families magical
spells and formul&aelig; are handed down from one generation
to another, are so many proofs of the survival of Druidic
tradition, however feeble. Females are generally the
conservators of these mysteries, and that there were
Druid priestesses is fairly certain.</p>
<p>The sea-snake&rsquo;s egg, or adder&rsquo;s stone, which is so
frequently alluded to in Druidic magical tales, otherwise
called <i>Glain Neidr</i>, was said to have been formed, about
midsummer, by an assemblage of snakes. A bubble
formed on the head of one of them was blown by others
down the whole length of its back, and then, hardening,
became a crystal ring. It was used as one of the
insignia of the Archdruid, and was supposed to assist
in augury.</p>
<p>The <i>herbe d&rsquo;or</i>, or &lsquo;golden herb,&rsquo; was a medicinal plant
much in favour among the Breton peasantry. It is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
<i>selago</i> of Pliny, which in Druidical times was gathered
with the utmost veneration by a hand enveloped with a
garment once worn by a sacred person. The owner of
the hand was arrayed in white, with bare feet, washed
in pure water. In after times the plant was thought to
shine from a distance like gold, and to give to those who
trod on it the power of understanding the language of
dogs, wolves, and birds.</p>
<p>These, with the mistletoe, the favourite Druidical plant,
the sorcerer is entreated, in an old balled, to lay aside,
to seek no more for vain enchantments, but to remember
that he is a Christian.</p>
<h3><i>AbÃ©lard and HÃ©loÃ¯se</i></h3>
<p>The touching story of the love of AbÃ©lard and HÃ©loÃ¯se
has found its way into Breton legend as a tale of
sorcery. AbÃ©lard was a Breton. The Duke of Brittany,
whose subject he was born, jealous of the glory of
France, which then engrossed all the most famous
scholars of Europe, and being, besides, acquainted with
the persecution AbÃ©lard had suffered from his enemies,
had nominated him to the Abbey of St Gildas, and, by
this benefaction and mark of his esteem, engaged him
to pass the rest of his days in his dominions. AbÃ©lard
received this favour with great joy, imagining that by
leaving France he would quench his passion for HÃ©loÃ¯se
and gain a new peace of mind upon entering into his
new dignity.</p>
<p>The Abbey of St Gildas de Rhuys was founded on the
inaccessible coast near Vannes by St Gildas, a British
saint, the schoolfellow and friend of St Samson of Dol
and St Pol of LÃ©on, and counted among its monks the
Saxon St Dunstan, who, carried by pirates from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
native isle, settled on the desolate shores of Brittany
and became, under the name of St Goustan, the patron
of mariners.</p>
<p>St Gildas built his abbey on the edge of a high, rocky
promontory, the site of an ancient Roman encampment,
called Grand Mont, facing the shore, where the sea has
formed numerous caverns in the rocks. The rocks are
composed chiefly of quartz, and are covered to a considerable
height with small mussels. AbÃ©lard, on his
appointment to the Abbey of St Gildas, made over
to HÃ©loÃ¯se the celebrated abbey he had founded at
Nogent, near Troyes, which he called the Paraclete, or
Comforter, because he there found comfort and refreshment
after his troubles. With Nogent he was to leave
his peace. His gentle nature was unable to contend
against the coarse and unruly Breton monks. As
he writes in his well-known letter to HÃ©loÃ¯se, setting
forth his griefs: &ldquo;I inhabit a barbarous country where
the language is unknown to me. I have no dealings
with the ferocious inhabitants. I walk the inaccessible
borders of the stormy sea, and my monks have no other
rule than their own. I wish that you could see my
dwelling. You would not believe it an abbey. The
doors are ornamented only with the feet of deer, of
wolves and bears, boars, and the hideous skins of owls.
I find each day new perils. I expect at every moment
to see a sword suspended over my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to outline the history of AbÃ©lard.
Suffice it to say that he was one of the most brilliant
scholars and dialecticians of all time, possessing a
European reputation in his day. Falling in love with
HÃ©loÃ¯se, niece of Fulbert, a canon of Paris, he awoke in
her a similar absorbing passion, which resulted in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
mutual disgrace and AbÃ©lard&rsquo;s mutilation by the incensed
uncle. He and his HÃ©loÃ¯se were buried in one tomb
at the Paraclete. The story of their love has been
immortalized by the world&rsquo;s great poets and painters.</p>
<p>An ancient Breton ballad on the subject has been spoken
of as a &ldquo;naÃ¯f and horrible&rdquo; production, in which one
will find &ldquo;a bizarre mixture of Druidic practice and
Christian superstition.&rdquo; It describes HÃ©loÃ¯se as a
sorceress of ferocious and sanguinary temper. Thus
can legend magnify and distort human failing! As its
presentation is important in the study of Breton folk-lore,
I give a very free translation of this ballad, in
which, at the same time, I have endeavoured to preserve
the atmosphere of the original.</p>
<h4>THE HYMN OF HÃLOÃSE</h4>

<p>Nor word of French nor Roman tongue,</p>

<p>The wolf, the serpent, the crow, the owl,</p>

</div></div>
<p>It is difficult to over-estimate the folk-lore value of
such a ballad as this. Its historical value is clearly
<i>nil</i>. We have no proof that HÃ©loÃ¯se was a Breton;
but fantastic errors of this description are so well
known to the student of ballad literature that he is
able to discount them easily in gauging the value of a
piece.</p>
<p>In this weird composition the wretched abbess is described
as an alchemist as well as a sorceress, and she
descends to the depths of the lowest and most revolting
witchcraft. She practises shape-shifting and similar arts.
She has power over natural forces, and knows the past,
the present, and the things to be. She possesses
sufficient Druidic knowledge to permit her to gather
the greatly prized serpent&rsquo;s egg, to acquire which was
the grand aim of the Celtic magician. The circumstances
of the ballad strongly recall those of the poem
in which the Welsh bard Taliesin recounts his magical
experiences, his metamorphoses, his knowledge of the
darker mysteries of nature.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<h3><i>Nantes of the Magicians</i></h3>
<p>The poet is in accord with probability in making the
magical exploits of AbÃ©lard and HÃ©loÃ¯se take place at
Nantes&mdash;a circumstance not indicated in the translation
owing to metrical exigencies. Nantes was, indeed, a
classic neighbourhood of sorcery. An ancient college
of Druidic priestesses was situated on one of the islands
at the mouth of the Loire, and the traditions of its
denizens had evidently been cherished by the inhabitants
of the city even as late as the middle of the fourteenth
century, for we find a bishop of the diocese at that period
obtaining a bull of excommunication against the local
sorcerers, and condemning them to the eternal fires with
bell, book, and candle.<a name='FNanchor_0053' id='FNanchor_0053'></a><a href='#Footnote_0053' class='fnanchor'>[53]</a></p>
<p>The poet, it is plain, has confounded poor HÃ©loÃ¯se with
the dark sisterhood of the island of the Loire. The
learning she received from her gifted lover had been
her undoing in Breton eyes, for the simple folk of
the duchy at the period the ballad gained currency
could scarcely be expected to discriminate between a
training in rhetoric and philosophy and a schooling in
the <i>grimoires</i> and other accomplishments of the pit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X: ARTHURIAN ROMANCE IN BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Fierce</span> and prolonged has been the debate as to
the original birthplace of Arthurian legend, authorities
of the first rank, the &lsquo;Senior Wranglers&rsquo; of
the study, as Nutt has called them, hotly advancing
the several claims of Wales, England, Scotland, and
Brittany. In this place it would be neither fitting
nor necessary to traverse the whole ground of argument,
and we must content ourselves with the examination
of Brittany&rsquo;s claim to the invention of Arthurian
story&mdash;and this we will do briefly, passing on to some
of the tales which relate the deeds of the King or his
knights on Breton soil.</p>
<p>Confining ourselves, then, to the proof of the existence
of a body of Arthurian legend in Brittany, we are,
perhaps, a little alarmed at the outset to find that our
manuscript sources are scanty. &ldquo;It had to be acknowledged,&rdquo;
says Professor Saintsbury, &ldquo;that Brittany could
supply <i>no ancient texts whatever</i>, and hardly any ancient
traditions.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0054' id='FNanchor_0054'></a><a href='#Footnote_0054' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a> But are either of these conditions essential
to a belief in the Breton origin of Arthurian romance?</p>
<p>The two great hypotheses regarding Arthurian origins
have been dubbed the &lsquo;Continental&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Insular&rsquo;
theories. The first has as its leading protagonist Professor
Wendelin FÃ¶rster of Bonn, who believes that the
immigrant Britons brought the Arthur legend with them
to Brittany and that the Normans of Normandy received
it from their descendants and gave it wider territorial
scope. The second school, headed by the brilliant
M. Gaston Paris, believes that it originated in Wales.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>If we consider the first theory, then, we can readily see
that ancient <i>texts</i> are not essential to its acceptance.
In any case the entire body of Arthurian texts prior
to the twelfth century is so small as to be almost
negligible. The statement that &ldquo;hardly any ancient
traditions&rdquo; of the Arthurian legend exist in Brittany
is an extraordinary one. In view of the circumstances
that in extended passages of Arthurian story the scene
is laid in Brittany (as in the Merlin and Vivien incident
and the episode of Yseult of the White Hand in the
story of Tristrem), that Geoffrey of Monmouth speaks
of &ldquo;the Breton book&rdquo; from which he took his matter,
and that Marie de France states that her tales are drawn
from old Breton sources, not to admit the possible existence
of a body of Arthurian tradition in Brittany appears
capricious. Thomas&rsquo;s <i>Sir Tristrem</i> is professedly based
on the poem of the Breton BrÃ©ri, and there is no reason
why Brittany, drawing sap and fibre as it did from
Britain, should not have produced Arthurian stories of
its own.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, that seems to represent the sum
of its pretensions as a main source of Arthurian romance.
The Arthurian story seems to be indigenous to British
soil, and if we trace the origin of certain episodes to
Brittany we may safely connect these with the early
British immigrants to the peninsula. This is not to
say, however, that Brittany did not influence Norman
appreciation of the Arthurian saga. But that it did so
more than did Wales is unlikely, in view of documentary
evidence. Both Wales and Brittany, then, supplied
matter which the Norman and French poets shaped
into verse, and if Brittany was not the birthplace of the
legend it was, in truth, one of its cradle-domains.</p>

<h3><i>The Sword of Arthur</i></h3>
<p>Let us collect, then, Arthurian incidents which take
place in Brittany. First, Arthur&rsquo;s finding of the marvellous
sword Excalibur would seem to happen there,
as Vivien, or Nimue, the Lady of the Lake, was undoubtedly
a fairy of Breton origin who does not appear
in British myth.</p>
<p>For the manner in which Arthur acquired the renowned
Excalibur, or Caliburn, the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i> is the
authority. The King had broken his sword in two
pieces in a combat with Sir Pellinore of Wales, and
had been saved by Merlin, who threw Sir Pellinore
into an enchanted sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Merlin and Arthur departed, and as they rode
along King Arthur said, &lsquo;I have no sword.&rsquo; &lsquo;No
force,&rsquo;<a name='FNanchor_0055' id='FNanchor_0055'></a><a href='#Footnote_0055' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> said Merlin; &lsquo;here is a sword that shall be
yours, an I may.&rsquo; So they rode till they came to a lake,
which was a fair water and a broad; and in the midst
of the lake King Arthur was aware of an arm clothed
in white samite, that held a fair sword in the hand.
&lsquo;Lo,&rsquo; said Merlin unto the King, &lsquo;yonder is the sword
that I spoke of.&rsquo; With that they saw a damsel going
upon the lake. &lsquo;What damsel is that?&rsquo; said the King.
&lsquo;That is the Lady of the Lake,&rsquo; said Merlin; &lsquo;and
within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place
as any on earth, and richly beseen; and this damsel will
come to you anon, and then speak fair to her that she
will give you that sword.&rsquo; Therewith came the damsel
to King Arthur and saluted him, and he her again.
&lsquo;Damsel,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;what sword is that which the
arm holdeth yonder above the water? I would it were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
mine, for I have no sword.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir King,&rsquo; said the damsel
of the lake, &lsquo;that sword is mine, and if ye will give me
a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.&rsquo; &lsquo;By my faith,&rsquo;
said King Arthur, &lsquo;I will give you any gift that you will
ask or desire.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the damsel, &lsquo;go into yonder
barge, and row yourself unto the sword, and take it and
the scabbard with you; and I will ask my gift when I
see my time.&rsquo; So King Arthur and Merlin alighted,
tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the
barge. And when they came to the sword that the hand
held, King Arthur took it up by the handles, and took
it with him, and the arm and the hand went under the
water; and so came to the land and rode forth. King
Arthur looked upon the sword, and liked it passing
well. &lsquo;Whether liketh you better,&rsquo; said Merlin, &lsquo;the
sword or the scabbard?&rsquo; &lsquo;Me liketh better the sword,&rsquo;
said King Arthur. &lsquo;Ye are more unwise,&rsquo; said Merlin,
&lsquo;for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword; for while
ye have the scabbard upon you, ye shall lose no blood,
be ye never so sore wounded; therefore keep well the
scabbard alway with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

KING ARTHUR AND MERLIN AT THE LAKE<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Sir Lancelot du Lac, son of King Ban of Benwik, was
stolen and brought up by the Lady of the Lake, from
whose enchanted realm he took his name. But he does
not appear at all in true Celtic legend, and is a mere
Norman new-comer.</p>
<h3><i>Tristrem and Ysonde</i></h3>
<p>Following the Arthurian &lsquo;chronology&rsquo; as set forth in
the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>, we reach the great episode of Sir
Tristrem of Lyonesse, a legendary country off the coast
of Cornwall. This most romantic yet most human tale
must be accounted one of the world&rsquo;s supreme love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
stories. It has inspired some of our greatest poets, and
moved Richard Wagner to the composition of a splendid
opera.</p>
<p>One of the first to bring this literary treasure to public
notice was Sir Walter Scott, who felt a strong chord
vibrate in his romantic soul when perusing that version
of the tale of which Thomas of Ercildoune is the
reputed author. Taking this as the best and most
ancient version of <i>Tristrem</i>, we may detail its circumstances
as follows:</p>
<p>The Duke Morgan and Roland Rise, Lord of Ermonie,
two Cymric chieftains, had long been at feud, and at
length the smouldering embers of enmity burst into open
flame. In the contest that ensued the doughty Roland
prevailed, but he was a generous foe, and granted
a seven years&rsquo; truce to his defeated adversary. Some
time after this event Roland journeyed into Cornwall
to the Court of Mark, where he carried off the honours
in a tourney. But he was to win a more precious
prize in the love of the fair Princess Blancheflour, sister
of King Mark, who grew to adore him passionately.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Duke Morgan took foul advantage of the
absence of Roland, and invaded his land. Rohand, a
trusty vassal of Roland, repaired to Cornwall, where he
sought out his master and told him of Morgan&rsquo;s broken
faith. Then Roland told Blancheflour of his plight,
how that he must return to his own realm, and she,
fearing her brother Mark, because she had given her
love to Roland without the King&rsquo;s knowledge, resolved
to fly with her lover. The pair left Cornwall hurriedly,
and, reaching one of Roland&rsquo;s castles, were wed there.
Roland, however, had soon to don his armour, for news
was brought to him that Duke Morgan was coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
against him with a great army. A fierce battle ensued,
in which Roland at first had the advantage, but the
Duke, being reinforced, pressed him hotly, and in the
end Roland was defeated and slain. Blancheflour
received news of her lord&rsquo;s death immediately before
the birth of her son, and, sore stricken by the woeful
news, she named him Tristrem, or &lsquo;Child of Sorrow.&rsquo;
Then, recommending him to the care of Rohand, to
whom she gave a ring which had belonged to King
Mark, her brother, to prove Tristrem&rsquo;s relationship to
that prince, she expired, to the intense grief of all her
attendants. To secure the safety of his ward, Rohand
passed him off as his own child, inverting the form of
his name to &lsquo;Tremtris.&rsquo; Duke Morgan now ruled
over the land of Ermonie, and Rohand had perforce to
pay him a constrained homage.</p>
<p>When he arrived at a fitting age Tristrem was duly
instructed in all knightly games and exercises by his
foster-father, and grew apace in strength and skill.
Once a Norwegian vessel arrived upon the coast of
Ermonie laden with a freight of hawks and treasure
(hawks at that period were often worth their weight
in gold). The captain challenged anyone to a game of
chess with him for a stake of twenty shillings, and
Rohand and his sons, with Tristrem, went on board
to play with him. Tristrem moved so skilfully that
he overcame the captain, and won from him, in many
games, six hawks and the sum of a hundred pounds.
While the games were proceeding Rohand went on
shore, leaving Tristrem in the care of his preceptor,
and the false captain, to avoid paying what he had lost,
forced the preceptor to go on shore alone and put to sea
with the young noble.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>The ship had no sooner sailed away than a furious gale
arose, and as it continued for some days the mariners
became convinced that the tempest was due to the
injustice of their captain, and being in sore dread, they
paid Tristrem his winnings and set him ashore. Dressed
in a robe of &lsquo;blihand brown&rsquo; (blue-brown), Tristrem
found himself alone on a rocky beach. First he knelt
and requested Divine protection, after which he ate
some food which had been left him by the Norwegians,
and started to journey through a forest, in which he
encountered two palmers, who told him that he was in
Cornwall. He offered these men gold to guide him to
the Court of the king of the country, which they willingly
undertook to do. On their way the travellers fell in
with a hunting party of nobles, and Tristrem was
shocked to see the awkward manner in which the huntsmen
cut up some stags they had slain. He could not
restrain his feeling, and disputed with the nobles upon
the laws of venerie. Then he proceeded to skin a buck
for their instruction, like a right good forester, and ended
by blowing the <i>mort</i> or death-token on a horn.</p>
<h3><i>Tristrem as Forester</i></h3>
<p>The nobles who beheld his skill were amazed, and
speedily carried the news to King Mark, who was highly
interested. Tristrem was brought to his presence and
told his story, but Mark did not recognize that he was
speaking to his own nephew. The King&rsquo;s favourable
impression was confirmed by Tristrem&rsquo;s skill in playing
the harp, and soon the youth had endeared himself to the
heart of the King, and was firmly settled at the Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rohand, distracted by the loss of his foster-son,
searched for him from one land to another without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
even renewing his tattered garments. At last he encountered
one of the palmers who had guided Tristrem
to the Court of King Mark, and learned of the great
honour accorded to his ward. At Rohand&rsquo;s request the
palmer took him to Mark&rsquo;s hall; but when Rohand
arrived thither his tattered and forlorn appearance
aroused the contempt of the porter and usher and they
refused him entrance. Upon bestowing liberal largess,
however, he was at length brought to Tristrem, who
presented him to King Mark as his father, acquainting
him at the same time with the cause of their separation.
When Rohand had been refreshed by a bath, and
richly attired by order of King Mark, the whole Court
marvelled at his majestic appearance.</p>
<p>Rohand, seated by King Mark&rsquo;s side at the banquet,
imparted to him the secret of Tristrem&rsquo;s birth, and in
proof showed him the ring given him by Blancheflour,
whereupon Mark at once joyfully recognized Tristrem
as his nephew. Rohand further told of the tragic fate
of Tristrem&rsquo;s parents through the treachery of Duke
Morgan, and Tristrem, fired by the tale of wrong, vowed
to return at once to Ermonie to avenge his father&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<h3><i>Tristrem Returns to Ermonie</i></h3>
<p>Although applauding his pious intention, Mark attempted
to dissuade his nephew from such an enterprise of peril,
until, seeing that Tristrem would not be gainsaid, the
King conferred upon him the honour of knighthood,
and furnished him with a thousand men-at-arms. Thus
equipped, Tristrem set sail for Ermonie, and, safely
arrived in that kingdom, he garrisoned Rohand&rsquo;s castle
with his Cornish forces.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>He had no intention of remaining inactive, however,
and once his men were cared for, he repaired to the Court
of the usurper, Duke Morgan, accompanied by fifteen
knights, each bearing a boar&rsquo;s head as a gift. But
Rohand, apprehending rashness on the part of his foster-son,
took the precaution of following with the Cornish
men-at-arms and his own vassals.</p>
<p>When Tristrem arrived the Duke was at the feast-board,
and he demanded Tristrem&rsquo;s name and business.
Tristrem boldly declared himself, and at the end of an
angry parley the Duke struck him a sore blow. A
moment later swords were flashing, and it might have
gone ill with Tristrem had not Rohand with his men
come up in the nick of time. In the end Duke Morgan
was slain and his followers routed. Having now
recovered his paternal domains Sir Tristrem conferred
them upon Rohand, to be held of himself as liege lord,
and having done so he took leave of his foster-father and
returned to Cornwall.</p>
<h3><i>The Combat with Moraunt</i></h3>
<p>On arriving at the palace of Mark, Tristrem found the
Court in dismay, because of a demand for tribute made
by the King of England. Moraunt, the Irish ambassador
to England, was charged with the duty of claiming the
tribute, which was no less than three hundred pounds
of gold, as many of coined silver, as many of tin, and a
levy every fourth year of three hundred Cornish children.
Mark protested bitterly, and Tristrem urged him to bid
defiance to the English, swearing that he would himself
defend the freedom of Cornwall. His aid was
reluctantly accepted by the Grand Council, and he
delivered to Moraunt a declaration that no tribute was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
due. Moraunt retorted by giving Tristrem the lie, and
the champions exchanged defiance. They sailed in
separate boats to a small island to decide the issue
in single combat, and when they had landed Tristrem
turned his boat adrift, saying sternly that one vessel
would suffice to take back the victor. The champions
mounted their steeds at the outset, but after the first
encounter Tristrem, leaping lightly from the saddle,
engaged his adversary on foot. The Knight of Ermonie
was desperately wounded in the thigh, but, rallying all
his strength, he cleft Moraunt to the chine, and, his
sword splintering, a piece of the blade remained in the
wound.</p>
<p>Tristrem now returned to the mainland, where so great
was the joy over his return that he was appointed
heir to Cornwall and successor to Mark the Good.
But his wound, having been inflicted by a poisoned
blade, grew more grievous day by day. No leech
might cure it, and the evil odour arising from the
gangrene drove every one from his presence save his
faithful servitor Gouvernayl.</p>
<h3><i>Fytte the Second</i></h3>
<p>Fytte (or Part) the Second commences by telling how
Tristrem, forsaken by all, begged King Mark for a ship
that he might leave the land of Cornwall. Mark reluctantly
granted his request, and the luckless Tristrem
embarked with Gouvernayl, his one attendant, and his
harp as his only solace. He steered for Caerleon, and
remained nine weeks at sea, but meeting contrary winds
he was driven out of his course, and at length came to
the Irish coast, where he sought the haven of Dublin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
On arriving there he feigned that he had been wounded
by pirates, and learning that he was in Ireland, and
recollecting that Moraunt, whom he had slain, was the
brother to the Queen of that land, he thought it wise
to assume once more the name of Tremtris.</p>
<p>Soon his fame as a minstrel reached the ears of the
Queen of Ireland, a lady deeply versed in the art
of healing. She was, indeed, &ldquo;the best Couthe of
Medicine&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0056' id='FNanchor_0056'></a><a href='#Footnote_0056' class='fnanchor'>[56]</a> Tristrem had seen, and in order to heal his
wound she applied to it &ldquo;a plaster kene.&rdquo; Later she
invited him to the Court, where his skill in chess and
games astonished every one. So interested in him did
the royal lady become at last that she undertook to cure
him, and effected her object by means of a medicated
bath and other medieval remedies. Then, on account
of his fame as a minstrel, he was given the task of
instructing the Princess Ysonde&mdash;as the name &lsquo;Yseult&rsquo;
is written in this particular version.</p>
<p>This princess was much attached to minstrelsy and
poetry, and under the tuition of Tristrem she rapidly
advanced in these arts, until at length she had no equal
in Ireland save her preceptor. And now Tristrem, his
health restored, and having completed Ysonde&rsquo;s instruction,
felt a strong desire to return to the Court of King
Mark. His request to be allowed to depart was most
unwillingly granted by the Queen, who at the leave-taking
loaded him with gifts. With the faithful Gouvernayl
he arrived safely in Cornwall, where Mark received
him joyfully. When the King inquired curiously how his
wound had been cured, Tristrem told him of the great
kindness of the Irish Queen, and praised Ysonde so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
highly that the ardour of his uncle was aroused and
he requested Tristrem to procure him the hand of the
damsel in marriage. He assured Tristrem that no
marriage he, the King, might contract would annul the
arrangement whereby Tristrem was to succeed to the
throne of Cornwall. The nobles were opposed to
the King&rsquo;s desires, which but strengthened Tristrem in
his resolve to undertake the embassage, for he thought
that otherwise it might appear that he desired the King
to remain unmarried.</p>
<h3><i>The Marriage Embassy</i></h3>
<p>With a retinue of fifteen knights Tristrem sailed to
Dublin in a ship richly laden with gifts. Arrived at
the Irish capital, he sent magnificent presents to the
King, Queen, and Princess, but did not announce the
nature of his errand. Hardly had his messengers
departed than he was informed that the people of
Dublin were panic-stricken at the approach of a terrible
dragon. This monster had so affrighted the neighbourhood
that the hand of the Princess had been offered to
anyone who would slay it. Tristrem dared his knights
to attack the dragon, but one and all declined, so he
himself rode out to give it battle. At the first shock
his lance broke on the monster&rsquo;s impenetrable hide, his
horse was slain, and he was forced to continue the fight
on foot. At length, despite its fiery breath, he succeeded
in slaying the dragon, and cut out its tongue
as a trophy. But this exuded a subtle poison which
deprived him of his senses.</p>
<p>Thus overcome, Tristrem was discovered by the King&rsquo;s
steward, who cut off the dragon&rsquo;s head and returned
with it to Court to demand the hand of Ysonde. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the Queen and her daughter were dubious of the man&rsquo;s
story, and upon visiting the place where the dragon
had been slain, they came upon Tristrem himself.
Their ministrations revived him, and he showed them
the dragon&rsquo;s tongue as proof that he had slain the dread
beast. He described himself as a merchant, and Ysonde,
who did not at first recognize him, expressed her regret
that he was not a knight. The Queen now caused him
to be conveyed to the palace, where he was refreshed
by a bath, and the false steward was cast into prison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the suspicions of the Princess had been
aroused, and the belief grew that this &lsquo;merchant&rsquo; who
had slain the dragon was none other than Tremtris,
her old instructor. In searching for evidence to confirm
this conjecture she examined his sword, from
which, she found, a piece had been broken. Now, she
possessed a fragment of a sword-blade which had been
taken out of the skull of Moraunt, her uncle, and she
discovered that this fragment fitted into the broken
place in Tristrem&rsquo;s sword, wherefore she concluded that
the weapon must have been that which slew the Irish
ambassador. She reproached Tristrem, and in her
passion rushed upon him with his own sword. At
this instant her mother returned, and upon learning the
identity of Tristrem she was about to assist Ysonde
to slay him in his bath when the King arrived and
saved him from the infuriated women. Tristrem defended
himself as having killed Moraunt in fair fight,
and, smiling upon Ysonde, he told her that she had had
many opportunities of slaying him while he was her
preceptor Tremtris. He then proceeded to make
known the object of his embassy. He engaged that
his uncle, King Mark, should marry Ysonde, and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
was agreed that she should be sent under his escort
to Cornwall.</p>
<p>It is clear that the Queen&rsquo;s knowledge of medicine was
accompanied by an acquaintance with the black art, for
on the eve of her daughter&rsquo;s departure she entrusted
to Brengwain, a lady of Ysonde&rsquo;s suite, a powerful
philtre or love potion, with directions that Mark and
his bride should partake of it on the night of their
marriage. While at sea the party met with contrary
winds, and the mariners were forced to take to their
oars. Tristrem exerted himself in rowing, and Ysonde,
remarking that he seemed much fatigued, called for
drink to refresh him. Brengwain, by a fateful error,
presented the cup which held the love potion. Both
Tristrem and Ysonde unwittingly partook of this, and
a favourite dog, Hodain,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>That many a forest day of fiery mirth</p>
<p>Had plied his craft before them,<a name='FNanchor_0057' id='FNanchor_0057'></a><a href='#Footnote_0057' class='fnanchor'>[57]</a></p>
</div></div>
<p>licked the cup. The consequence of this mistake was,
of course, the awakening of a consuming passion each
for the other in Tristrem and Ysonde. A fortnight
later the ship arrived at Cornwall. Ysonde was duly
wed to King Mark, but her passion for Tristrem moved
her to induce her <a name='TC_5'></a><ins title="Was 'attendent'">attendant</ins> Brengwain to take her
place on the first night of her nuptials.</p>
<p>Afterward, terrified lest Brengwain should disclose
the secret in her possession, Ysonde hired two ruffians
to dispatch her. But the damsel&rsquo;s entreaties softened
the hearts of the assassins and they spared her life.
Subsequently Ysonde repented of her action and Brengwain
was reinstated in full favour.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<h3><i>The Minstrel&rsquo;s Boon</i></h3>
<p>An Irish earl, a former admirer of Ysonde, arrived one
day at the Court of Cornwall disguised as a minstrel
and bearing a harp of curious workmanship, the appearance
of which excited the curiosity of King Mark, who
requested him to perform upon it. The visitor demanded
that the King should first promise to grant
him a boon, and the King having pledged his royal
word, the minstrel sang to the harp a lay in which he
claimed Ysonde as the promised gift.<a name='FNanchor_0058' id='FNanchor_0058'></a><a href='#Footnote_0058' class='fnanchor'>[58]</a> Mark, having
pledged his honour, had no alternative but to become
forsworn or to deliver his wife to the harper, and he
reluctantly complied with the minstrel&rsquo;s demand. Tristrem,
who had been away hunting, returned immediately
after the adventurous earl had departed with his fair
prize. He upbraided the King for his extravagant
sense of honour, and, snatching up his rote, or harp,
hastened to the seashore, where Ysonde had already
embarked. There he sat down and played, and the
sound so deeply affected Ysonde that she became
seriously ill, so that the earl was induced to return with
her to land. Ysonde pretended that Tristrem&rsquo;s music
was necessary to her recovery, and the earl, to whom
Tristrem was unknown, offered to take him in his train
to Ireland. The earl had dismounted from the horse
he was riding and was preparing to return on board,
when Tristrem sprang into the saddle, and, seizing
Ysonde&rsquo;s horse by the bridle, plunged into the forest.
Here the lovers remained for a week, after which
Tristrem restored Ysonde to her husband.</p>

TRISTREM AND YSONDE<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>Not unnaturally suspicion was aroused regarding the
relations between Tristrem and Ysonde. Meriadok, a
knight of Cornwall, and an intimate friend of Tristrem,
was perhaps the most suspicious of all, and one snowy
evening he traced his friend to Ysonde&rsquo;s bower, to
which Tristrem gained entrance by a sliding panel. In
this a piece of Tristrem&rsquo;s green kirtle was left, and
Meriadok bore the fragment to the King, to whom he
unfolded his suspicions. To test the truth of these
Mark pretended that he was going on a pilgrimage to
the Holy Land, and asked his wife to whose care she
would wish to be committed. Ysonde at first named
Tristrem, but on the advice of Brengwain resumed the
subject later and feigned a mortal hatred for her lover,
which she ascribed to the scandal she had suffered on
his account. The fears of the simple Mark were thus
lulled to sleep; but those of Meriadok were by no
means laid at rest. On his advice Mark definitely
separated the lovers, confining Ysonde to a bower
and sending Tristrem to a neighbouring city. But
Tristrem succeeded in communicating with Ysonde
by means of leafy twigs thrown into the river which
ran through her garden, and they continued to meet.</p>
<p>Their interviews were, however, discovered by the aid
of a dwarf who concealed himself in a tree. One
night Mark took the dwarf&rsquo;s place, but the lovers
were made aware of his presence by his shadow and
pretended to be quarrelling, Tristrem saying that
Ysonde had supplanted him in the King&rsquo;s affections.
Mark&rsquo;s suspicions were thus soothed for the time
being. On another occasion Tristrem was not so
fortunate, and, being discovered, was forced to flee
the country.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<h3><i>The Ordeal by Fire</i></h3>
<p>Mark now resolved to test his wife&rsquo;s innocence by the
dread ordeal by fire, and he journeyed with his Court
to Westminster, where the trial was to take place.
Tristrem, disguised as a peasant, joined the retinue, and
when the party arrived in the Thames he carried
Ysonde from the ship to the shore. When the moment
for the ordeal came the Queen protested her innocence,
saying that no man had ever laid hands upon her save
the King and the peasant who had carried her from the
ship. Mark, satisfied by her evident sincerity, refused
to proceed further with the trial, and Ysonde thus
escaped the awful test.</p>
<p>Tristrem then betook him to Wales, and the fame of
his prowess in that land came at length to Cornwall, so
that at last his uncle grew heavy at heart for his absence
and desired sight of him. Once more he returned, but
his fatal passion for Ysonde was not abated, and became
at length so grievous to the good King that he
banished both of the lovers from his sight. The two
fled to a forest, and there dwelt in a cavern, subsisting
upon venison, the spoil of Tristrem&rsquo;s bow. One day,
weary with the chase, Tristrem lay down to rest by the
side of the sleeping Ysonde, placing his drawn sword
between them. Mark, passing that way, espied them, and
from the naked sword inferring their innocence, became
reconciled to them once more. But again suspicion
fell upon them, and again Tristrem was forced to flee.</p>
<h3><i>Tristrem in Brittany</i></h3>
<p>After many adventures in Spain Tristrem arrived in
Brittany, where he aided the Duke of that country with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
his sword. The Duke&rsquo;s daughter, known as Ysonde
of the White Hand, hearing him sing one night a song
of the beauty of Ysonde, thought that Tristrem was in
love with her. The Duke therefore offered Tristrem
his daughter&rsquo;s hand, and, in despair of seeing Ysonde
of Ireland again, he accepted the honour. But on the
wedding-day the first Ysonde&rsquo;s ring dropped from his
finger as if reproaching him with infidelity, and in deep
remorse he vowed that Ysonde of Brittany should be
his wife in name only.</p>
<p>Now the Duke of Brittany bestowed on Tristrem a fair
demesne divided by an arm of the sea from the land of
a powerful and savage giant named Beliagog, and he
warned his son-in-law not to incur the resentment of this
dangerous neighbour. But one day Tristrem&rsquo;s hounds
strayed into the forest land of Beliagog, and their
master, following them, was confronted by the wrathful
owner. A long and cruel combat ensued, and at last
Tristrem lopped off one of the giant&rsquo;s feet. Thereupon
the monster craved mercy, which was granted on
the condition that he should build a hall in honour of
Ysonde of Ireland and her maiden, Brengwain. This
hall was duly raised, and upon its walls was portrayed
to the life the whole history of Tristrem, with pictures
of Ysonde of Ireland, Brengwain, Mark, and other
characters in the tale. Tristrem, the Duke, Ysonde of
Brittany, and Ganhardin, her brother, were riding to see
this marvel when Ysonde confessed to Ganhardin that
Tristrem did not regard her as his wife. Ganhardin,
angered, questioned Tristrem, who concealed nothing
from him and recounted to him the story of his love
for the Queen of Cornwall. Ganhardin was deeply
interested, and on beholding the picture of Brengwain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
in the newly erected hall he fell violently in love
with her.</p>
<h3><i>The Forest Lovers</i></h3>
<p>Tristrem now returned to Cornwall with Ganhardin, and
encountered Ysonde the Queen and the fair Brengwain.
But one Canados, the King&rsquo;s Constable, discovered
them and carried the ladies back to Court. Ganhardin
made the best of his way home to Brittany, but Tristrem
remained in Cornwall, disguised as a beggar.</p>
<p>Our story now tells of a great tournament at the Cornish
Court, and how Ganhardin hied him from Brittany and
rejoined Tristrem. The two entered the lists and took
up the challenge of Meriadok and Canados. Tristrem,
tilting at his old enemy, wounded him desperately.
The issue of the combat between Canados and Ganhardin
hung in the balance when Tristrem, charging at the
Constable, overthrew and slew him. Then, fired with
the lust of conquest, Tristrem bore down upon his foes
and exacted a heavy toll of lives. So great was the
scathe done that day that Tristrem and Ganhardin
were forced once more to fly to Brittany, where in
an adventure Tristrem received an arrow in his old
wound.</p>
<h3><i>The French Manuscript</i></h3>
<p>At this point the Auchinleck MS., from which this
account is taken, breaks off, and the story is concluded,
in language similar to that of the original, by Sir Walter
Scott, who got his materials from an old French version
of the tale.</p>
<p>We read that Tristrem suffered sorely from his wound,
in which, as before, gangrene set in. Aware that none
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
but Ysonde of Ireland could cure him, the stricken
knight called Ganhardin to his side and urged him to
go with all speed to Cornwall and tell the Queen of his
mortal extremity. He entrusted him with his ring, and
finally requested the Breton knight to take with him two
sails, one white and the other black, the first to be
hoisted upon his return should Ysonde accompany him
back to Brittany, the sable sail to be raised should his
embassy fail of success. Now Ysonde of Brittany overheard
all that was said, her jealous fears were confirmed,
and she resolved to be revenged upon her husband.</p>
<p>Ganhardin voyaged quickly to Cornwall, and arrived at
the Court of King Mark disguised as a merchant. In
order to speed his mission he presented rich gifts to the
King, and also a cup to Ysonde, into which he dropped
Tristrem&rsquo;s ring. This token procured him a private
audience with the Queen, and when she learned the
deadly peril of her lover, Ysonde hastily disguised
herself and fled to the ship with Ganhardin. In due
course the vessel arrived off the coast of Brittany,
carrying the white sail which was to signify to Tristrem
that Ysonde was hastening to his aid. But Ysonde of
Brittany was watching, and perceiving from the signal
that her rival was on board she hurried to her husband&rsquo;s
couch. Tristrem begged her to tell him the colour of
the sail, and in the madness of jealousy Ysonde said
that it was black, upon which, believing himself forsaken
by his old love, the knight sank back and
expired.</p>
<p>Tristrem had scarce breathed his last when Ysonde
entered the castle. At the gate an old man was
mourning Tristrem&rsquo;s death, and hearing the ominous
words which he uttered she hastened to the chamber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
where the corpse of him she had loved so well was
lying. With a moan she cast herself upon the body,
covering the dead face with kisses and pleading upon
the silent lips to speak. Realizing at last that the spirit
had indeed quitted its mortal tenement, she raised
herself to her feet and stood for a moment gazing wildly
into the fixed and glassy eyes; then with a great cry
she fell forward upon the breast of her lover and was
united with him in death.</p>
<p>Other versions of the story, with all the wealth of
circumstance dear to the writer of romance, tell of the
grievous mourning made at the death of the lovers,
whom no fault of their own had doomed to the tyranny
of a mutual passion, and it is recounted that even King
Mark, wronged and shamed as he was, was unable to
repress his grief at their pitiful end.</p>
<p>Despite the clumsiness of much of its machinery, despite
its tiresome repetitions and its minor blemishes, this
tale of a grand passion must ever remain one of the
world&rsquo;s priceless literary possessions. &ldquo;Dull must he
be of soul&rdquo; who, even in these days when folk no longer
expire from an excess of the tender passion, can fail to
be moved by the sad fate of the fair Queen and of her
gallant minstrel-knight.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Swiche lovers als thei</p>
<p>Never schal be moe.</p>
</div></div>
<p>And so they take their place with Hero and Leander,
with AbÃ©lard and HÃ©loÃ¯se, with Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>It would be unfitting here to tell how mythology
has claimed the story of Tristrem and Ysonde and has
attempted to show in what manner the circumstances
of their lives and adventures have been adapted to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
old world-wide myth of the progress of the sun from
dawn to darkness.<a name='FNanchor_0059' id='FNanchor_0059'></a><a href='#Footnote_0059' class='fnanchor'>[59]</a> The evidence seems very complete,
and the theory is probably well founded. The circumstances
of the great epic of the sun-god fits most
hero-tales. And it is well to recollect that even if
romance-makers seized upon the plot of the old myth
they did so unconscious of its mythic significance, and
probably because it may have been employed in the
heroic literature of &ldquo;Rome la grant.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>The Giant of Mont-Saint-Michel</i></h3>
<p>It was when he arrived in Brittany to ward off the
projected invasion of England by the Roman Emperor
Lucius that King Arthur encountered and slew a giant
of &ldquo;marvellous bigness&rdquo; at St Michael&rsquo;s Mount, near
Pontorson. This monster, who had come from Spain,
had made his lair on the summit of the rocky island,
whither he had carried off the Lady Helena, niece of
Duke Hoel of Brittany. Many were the knights who
surrounded the giant&rsquo;s fastness, but none might come
at him, for when they attacked him he would sink their
ships by hurling mighty boulders upon them, while
those who succeeded in swimming to the island were
slain by him ere they could get a proper footing. But
Arthur, undismayed by what he had heard, waited until
nightfall; then, when all were asleep, with Kay the
seneschal and Bedivere the butler, he started on his
way to the Mount.</p>
<p>As the three approached the rugged height they beheld
a fire blazing brightly on its summit, and saw also that
upon a lesser eminence in the sea some distance away
a smaller fire was burning. Bedivere was dispatched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
in a boat to discover who had lit the fire on the smaller
island. Having landed there, he found an old woman
lamenting loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;wherefore do you mourn?
What has befallen you in this place that you weep so
sorely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, young sir,&rdquo; replied the dame, drying her tears,
&ldquo;get thee back from this place, I beseech thee, for as
thou livest the monster who inhabits yonder mount will
rend thee limb from limb and sup on thy flesh. But
yesterday I was the nurse of the fair Helena, niece to
Duke Hoel, who lies buried here by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! then, the lady is no more?&rdquo; cried Bedivere, in
distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; replied the old woman, weeping more bitterly
than ever, &ldquo;for when that accursed giant did seize upon
her terror did so overcome her that her spirit took flight.
But tarry not on this dread spot, noble youth, for if her
fierce slayer should encounter thee he will put thee to a
shameful death, and afterward devour thee as is his wont
with all those whom he kills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bedivere comforted the old woman as best he might,
and, returning to Arthur, told him what he had heard.
Now on hearing of the damsel&rsquo;s death great anger took
hold upon the King, so that he resolved to search out
the giant forthwith and slay or be slain by him. Desiring
Kay and Bedivere to follow, he dismounted and commenced
to climb St Michael&rsquo;s Mount, closely attended
by his companions.</p>

KING ARTHUR AND THE GIANT OF MONT-SAINT-MICHEL<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>On reaching the summit a gruesome spectacle awaited
them. The great fire that they had seen in the distance
was blazing fiercely, and bending over it was the giant,
his cruel and contorted features besmeared with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
blood of swine, portions of which he was toasting on
spits. Startled at the sight of the knights, the monster
rushed to where his club lay. This purpose Arthur
deemed he might prevent, and, covering himself with
his shield, he ran at him while yet he fumbled for the
weapon. But with all his agility he was too late, for
the giant seized the mighty sapling and, whirling it in
the air, brought it down on the King&rsquo;s shield with such
force that the sound of the stroke echoed afar. Nothing
daunted, Arthur dealt a trenchant stroke with Excalibur,
and gave the giant a cut on the forehead which made the
blood gush forth over his eyes so as nearly to blind him.
But shrewd as was the blow, the giant had warded his
forehead with his club in such wise that he had not
received a deadly wound, and, watching his chance with
great cunning, he rushed in within the sweep of Arthur&rsquo;s
sword, gripped him round the middle, and forced him
to the ground.</p>
<p>Iron indeed would have been the grasp which could
have held a knight so doughty as Arthur. Slipping
from the monster&rsquo;s clutches, the King hacked at his
adversary now in one place, now in another, till at
length he smote the giant so mightily that Excalibur
was buried deep in his brain-pan. The giant fell like
an oak torn up by the roots in the fury of the winds.
Rushing up as he crashed to the earth, Sir Bedivere
struck off the hideous head, grinning in death, to be
a show to those in the tents below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let them behold it in silence and without laughter,&rdquo;
the King charged Sir Bedivere, &ldquo;for never since I slew
the giant Ritho upon Mount Eryri have I encountered
so mighty an adversary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they returned to their tents with daybreak.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<h3><i>A Doubting Thomas</i></h3>
<p>It is strange to think that Brittany, one of the cradles
of Arthurian legend, could have produced a disbeliever
in that legend so early as the year of grace 1113.
It is on record that some monks from Brittany
journeyed to England in that year, and were shown
by the men of Devon &ldquo;the chair and the oven of that
King Arthur renowned in the stories of the Britons.&rdquo;
They passed on to Cornwall, and when, in the church
at Bodmin, one of their servants dared to question
the statement of a certain Cornishman that Arthur
still lived, he received such a buffet for his temerity
that a small riot ensued.<a name='FNanchor_0060' id='FNanchor_0060'></a><a href='#Footnote_0060' class='fnanchor'>[60]</a> Does not this seem to be
evidence that the legend was more whole-heartedly
believed in in the Celtic parts of England, and was
therefore more exclusively native to those parts than
to Continental Brittany? The Cornish allegiance to
the memory of Arthur seems to have left little to be
desired.</p>
<h3><i>Arthur and the Dragon</i></h3>
<p>The manner in which Arthur slew a dragon at the Lieue
de GrÃ¨ve, and at the same time made the acquaintance
of St Efflam of Ireland, is told by Albert le Grand,
monk of Morlaix. Arthur had been sojourning at the
Court of Hoel, Duke of Armorica, and, having freed
his own land of dragons and other monsters, was engaged
in hunting down the great beasts with which
Armorica abounded. But the monster which infested
the Lieue de GrÃ¨ve was no ordinary dragon. Indeed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
he was the most cunning saurian in Europe, and was
wont to retire backward into the great cavern in which
he lived so that when traced to it those who tracked
him would believe that he had just quitted it.</p>
<p>In this manner he succeeded in deceiving Arthur and
his knights, who for days lingered in the vicinity of
his cave in the hope of encountering him. One day
as they stood on the seashore waiting for the dragon
a sail hove in sight, and soon a large coracle made of
wicker-work covered with skins appeared. The vessel
grounded and its occupants leapt ashore, headed by
a young man of princely mien, who advanced toward
Arthur and saluted him courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to what shore have I come? I
am Efflam, the King&rsquo;s son, of Ireland. The winds
have driven us out of our course, and full long have
we laboured in the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when Arthur heard the young man&rsquo;s name he
embraced him heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, cousin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are in the land
of Brittany. I am Arthur of Britain, and I rejoice at
this meeting, since it may chance from it that I can
serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Efflam told Arthur the reason of his voyaging.
He had been wed to the Princess Enora, daughter of
a petty king of Britain, but on his wedding night a
strong impulse had come upon him to leave all and
make his penitence within some lonely wood, where he
could be at peace from the world. Rising from beside
his sleeping wife, he stole away, and rousing several
trusty servitors he set sail from his native shores.
Soon his frail craft was caught in a tempest, and after
many days driven ashore as had been seen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>Arthur marvelled at the impulse which had prompted
Efflam to seek retirement, and was about to express his
surprise when the youth startled him by telling him
that as his vessel had approached the shore he and his
men had caught sight of the dragon entering his cave.</p>
<p>At these words Arthur armed himself without delay
with his sword Excalibur and his lance Ron, and,
followed by his knights and by Efflam, drew near the
cavern. As he came before the entrance the dragon
issued forth, roaring in so terrible a manner that all but
the King were daunted and drew back. The creature&rsquo;s
appearance was fearsome in the extreme. He had one
red eye in the centre of his forehead, his shoulders
were covered with green scales like plates of mail, his
long, powerful tail was black and twisted, and his vast
mouth was furnished with tusks like those of a wild
boar.</p>
<p>Grim and great was the combat. For three days did
it rage, man and beast struggling through the long
hours for the mastery which neither seemed able to
obtain. At the end of that time the dragon retired for
a space into his lair, and Arthur, worn out and well-nigh
broken by the long-drawn strife, threw himself
down beside Efflam in a state of exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A draught of water, fair cousin,&rdquo; he cried in a choking
voice. &ldquo;I perish with thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no water was to be found in that place save that of
the salt sea which lapped the sands of GrÃ¨ve. Efflam,
however, was possessed of a faith that could overcome
all difficulties. Kneeling, he engaged in earnest prayer,
and, arising, struck the hard rock three times with his
rod. &ldquo;Our blessed Lord will send us water,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
and no sooner had he spoken than from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
stone a fountain of pure crystal water gushed and
bubbled.</p>
<p>With a cry of ecstasy Arthur placed his lips to the
stream and quaffed the much-needed refreshment. His
vigour restored, he was about to return to the dragon&rsquo;s
cavern to renew the combat when he was restrained
by Efflam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said he of Ireland, &ldquo;you have tried what can
be done by force; now let us see what can be achieved
by prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur, marvelling and humbled, sat near the young
man as he prayed. All night he was busied in devotions,
and at sunrise he arose and walked boldly to the
mouth of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou spawn of Satan,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;in the name of God
I charge thee to come forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A noise as of a thousand serpents hissing in unison
followed this challenge, and from out his lair trailed the
great length of the dragon, howling and vomiting fire
and blood. Mounting to the summit of a neighbouring
rock, he vented a final bellow and then cast himself into
the sea. The blue water was disturbed as by a maelstrom;
then all was peace again.</p>
<p>So perished the dragon of the Lieue de GrÃ¨ve, and
so was proved the superiority of prayer over human
strength and valour. St Efflam and his men settled on
the spot as hermits, and were miraculously fed by angels.
Efflam&rsquo;s wife, Enora, was borne to him by angels in
that place, only to die when she had joined him. And
when they came to tell Efflam that his new-found lady
was no more and was lying cold in the cell he had
provided for her, their news fell on deaf ears, for he too
had passed away. He is buried in Plestin Church, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
his effigy, standing triumphant above an open-mouthed
dragon, graces one of its many niches.</p>
<h3><i>The Isle of Avalon</i></h3>
<p>The Bretons believe that an island off TrÃ©gastel, on
the coast of the department of CÃ´tes-du-Nord, is the
fabled Isle of Avalon to which King Arthur, sore
wounded after his last battle, was borne to be healed of
his hurts. With straining eyes the fisherman watches
the mist-wrapped islet, and, peering through the
evening haze, cheats himself into the belief that giant
forms are moving upon its shores and that spectral
shapes flit across its sands&mdash;that the dark hours bring
back the activities of the attendant knights and enchantresses
of the mighty hero of Celtdom, who, refreshed by
his long repose, will one day return to the world of
men and right the great wrongs which afflict humanity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI: THE BRETON LAYS OF MARIE DE FRANCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> wonderful <i>Lais</i> of Marie de France must
ever hold a deep interest for all students of
Breton lore, for though cast in the literary
mould of Norman-French and breathing the spirit of
Norman chivalry those of them which deal with Brittany
(as do most of them) exhibit such evident marks of
having been drawn from native Breton sources that we
may regard them as among the most valuable documents
extant for the study and consideration of Armorican
story.</p>
<p>Of the personal history of Marie de France very little
is known. The date and place of her birth are still
matters for conjecture, and until comparatively recent
times literary antiquaries were doubtful even as to
which century she flourished in. In the epilogue to
her <i>Fables</i> she states that she is a native of the Ile-de-France,
but despite this she is believed to have been of
Norman origin, and also to have lived the greater part
of her life in England. Her work, which holds few
suggestions of Anglo-Norman forms of thought or
expression, was written in a literary dialect that in all
likelihood was widely estranged from the common
Norman tongue, and from this (though the manuscripts
in which they are preserved are dated later) we may
judge her poems to have been composed in the second
half of the twelfth century. The prologue of her <i>Lais</i>
contains a dedication to some unnamed king, and her
<i>Fables</i> are inscribed to a certain Count William, circumstances
which are held by some to prove that she was
of noble origin and not merely a <i>trouvÃ¨re</i> from necessity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>Until M. Gaston Paris decided that this mysterious
king was Henry II of England, and that the &lsquo;Count
William&rsquo; was Longsword, Earl of Salisbury, Henry&rsquo;s
natural son by the &lsquo;Fair Rosamond,&rsquo; the mysterious
monarch was believed to be Henry III. It is highly
probable that the <i>Lais</i> were actually written at the
Court of Henry II, though the &lsquo;King&rsquo; of the flowery
prologue is hardly reconcilable with the stern ruler and
law-maker of history. Be that as it may, Marie&rsquo;s poems
achieved instant success. &ldquo;Her rhyme is loved everywhere,&rdquo;
says Denis Pyramus, the author of a life of
St Edmund the King; &ldquo;for counts, barons, and knights
greatly admire it and hold it dear. And they love her
writing so much, and take such pleasure in it, that they
have it read, and often copied. These Lays are wont
to please ladies, who listen to them with delight, for
they are after their own hearts.&rdquo; This fame and its
attendant adulation were very sweet to Marie, and she
was justly proud of her work, which, inspired, as she herself
distinctly states, by the lays she had heard Breton
minstrels sing, has, because of its vivid colouring and
human appeal, survived the passing of seven hundred
years. The scenes of the tales are laid in Brittany, and
we are probably correct in regarding them as culled from
original traditional material. As we proceed with the
telling of these ancient stories we shall endeavour to point
out the essentially Breton elements they have retained.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of the Were-Wolf</i></h3>
<p>In the long ago there dwelt in Brittany a worshipful
baron, for whom the king of that land had a warm
affection, and who was happy in the esteem of his peers
and the love of his beautiful wife.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>One only grief had his wife in her married life, and that
was the mysterious absence of her husband for three
days in every week. Where he disappeared to neither
she nor any member of her household knew. These
excursions preyed upon her mind, so that at last she
resolved to challenge him regarding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Husband,&rdquo; she said to him pleadingly one day after
he had just returned from one of these absences, &ldquo;I
have something to ask of you, but I fear that my request
may vex you, and for this reason I hesitate to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baron took her in his arms and, kissing her tenderly,
bade her state her request, which he assured her would
by no means vex him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you will trust me sufficiently
to tell me where you spend those days when you are
absent from me. So fearful have I become regarding
these withdrawals and all the mystery that enshrouds
them that I know neither rest nor comfort; indeed, so
distraught am I at times that I feel I shall die for very
anxiety. Oh, husband, tell me where you go and why
you tarry so long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In great agitation the husband put his wife away from
him, not daring to meet the glance of her imploring,
anxious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the mercy of God, do not ask this of me,&rdquo; he
besought her. &ldquo;No good could come of your knowing,
only great and terrible evil. Knowledge would mean
the death of your love for me, and my everlasting
desolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jesting with me, husband,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but
it is a cruel jest. I am all seriousness, I do assure you.
Peace of mind can never be mine until my question is
fully answered.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>But the baron, still greatly perturbed, remained firm.
He could not tell her, and she must rest content with
that. The lady, however, continued to plead, sometimes
with tenderness, more often with tears and heart-piercing
reproaches, until at length the baron, trusting
to her love, decided to tell her his secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to leave you because periodically I become a
bisclaveret,&rdquo; he said. (&lsquo;Bisclaveret&rsquo; is the Breton name
for were-wolf.) &ldquo;I hide myself in the depths of the
forest, live on wild animals and roots, and go unclad as
any beast of the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the lady had recovered from the horror of this
disclosure and had rallied her senses to her aid, she
turned to him again, determined at any cost to learn
all the circumstances connected with this terrible
transformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I love you better than all the world,
my husband,&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;that never in our life together
have I done aught to forfeit your love or your
trust. So do, I beseech you, tell me all&mdash;tell me where
you hide your clothing before you become a were-wolf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I dare not do, dear wife,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for if I
should lose my raiment or even be seen quitting it I
must remain a were-wolf so long as I live. Never again
could I become a man unless my garments were restored
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you no longer trust me, no longer love me?&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Alas, alas that I have forfeited your
confidence! Oh that I should live to see such a
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her weeping broke out afresh, this time more piteously
than before. The baron, deeply touched, and willing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
by any means to alleviate her distress, at last divulged
the vital secret which he had held from her so long.</p>
<p>But from that hour his wife cast about for ways and
means to rid herself of her strange husband, of whom
she now went in exceeding fear. In course of time she
remembered a knight of that country who had long
sought her love, but whom she had repulsed. To him
she appealed, and right gladly and willingly he pledged
himself to aid her. She showed him where her lord
concealed his clothing, and begged him to spoil the
were-wolf of his vesture on the next occasion on which
he set out to assume his transformation. The fatal
period soon returned. The baron disappeared as usual,
but this time he did not return to his home. For days
friends, neighbours, and menials sought him diligently,
but no trace of him was to be found, and when a year
had elapsed the search was at length abandoned, and
the lady was wedded to her knight.</p>
<p>Some months later the King was hunting in the great
forest near the missing baron&rsquo;s castle. The hounds,
unleashed, came upon the scent of a wolf, and pressed
the animal hard. For many hours they pursued him,
and when about to seize him, Bisclaveret&mdash;for it was
he&mdash;turned with such a human gesture of despair to the
King, who had ridden hard upon his track, that the
royal huntsman was moved to pity. To the King&rsquo;s
surprise the were-wolf placed its paws together as if
in supplication, and its great jaws moved as if in
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call off the hounds,&rdquo; cried the monarch to his attendants.
&ldquo;This quarry we will take alive to our palace.
It is too marvellous a thing to be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly they returned to the Court, where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
were-wolf became an object of the greatest curiosity to
all. So frolicsome yet so gentle was he that he became
a universal favourite. At night he slept in the King&rsquo;s
room, and by day he followed him with all the dumb
faithfulness of a dog. The King was extremely attached
to him, and never permitted his shaggy favourite
to be absent from his side for a moment.</p>
<p>One day the monarch held a high Court, to which his
great vassals and barons and all the lords of his broad
demesnes were bidden. Among them came the knight
who had wed the wife of Bisclaveret. Immediately
upon sight of him the were-wolf flew at him with a
savage joy that astonished those accustomed to his
usual gentleness and docility. So fierce was the attack
that the knight would have been killed had not the
King intervened to save him. Later, in the royal
hunting-lodge she who had been the wife of Bisclaveret
came to offer the King a rich present. When he saw
her the animal&rsquo;s rage knew no bounds, and despite
all restraint he succeeded in mutilating her fair face
in the most frightful manner. But for a certain wise
counsellor this act would have cost Bisclaveret his life.
This sagacious person, who knew of the animal&rsquo;s
customary docility, insisted that some evil must have
been done him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some reason why this beast holds
these twain in such mortal hate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let this
woman and her husband be brought hither so that they
may be straitly questioned. She was once the wife of
one who was near to your heart, and many marvellous
happenings have ere this come out of Brittany.&rdquo;</p>

THE WERE-WOLF<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The King hearkened to this sage counsel, for he loved
the were-wolf, and was loath to have him slain. Under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
pressure of examination Bisclaveret&rsquo;s treacherous wife
confessed all that she had done, adding that in her
heart she believed the King&rsquo;s favourite animal to be
no other than her former husband.</p>
<p>Instantly on learning this the King demanded the
were-wolf&rsquo;s vesture from the treacherous knight her
lover, and when this was brought to him he caused
it to be spread before the wolf. But the animal behaved
as though he did not see the garments.</p>
<p>Then the wise counsellor again came to his aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take the beast to your own secret chamber,
sire,&rdquo; he told the King; &ldquo;for not without great shame
and tribulation can he become a man once more, and
this he dare not suffer in the sight of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice the King promptly followed, and when
after some little time he, with two lords of his fellowship
in attendance, re-entered the secret chamber, he
found the wolf gone, and the baron so well beloved
asleep in his bed.</p>
<p>With great joy and affection the King aroused his
friend, and when the baron&rsquo;s feelings permitted him
he related his adventures. As soon as his master had
heard him out he not only restored to him all that had
been taken from him, but added gifts the number and
richness of which rendered him more wealthy and
important than ever, while in just anger he banished
from his realm the wife who had betrayed her lord,
together with her lover.</p>
<h3><i>The Were-Wolf Superstition</i></h3>
<p>The were-wolf superstition is, or was, as prevalent in
Brittany as in other parts of France and Europe. The
term &lsquo;were-wolf&rsquo; literally means &lsquo;man-wolf,&rsquo; and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
applied to a man supposed to be temporarily or permanently
transformed into a wolf. In its origins the
belief may have been a phase of lycanthropy, a disease
in which the sufferer imagines himself to have been
transformed into an animal, and in ancient and medieval
times of very frequent occurrence. It may, on the
other hand, be a relic of early cannibalism. Communities
of semi-civilized people would begin to shun those who
devoured human flesh, and they would in time be
ostracized and classed with wild beasts, the idea that they
had something in common with these would grow, and
the belief that they were able to transform themselves
into veritable animals would be likely to arise therefrom.</p>
<p>There were two kinds of were-wolf, voluntary and
involuntary. The voluntary included those persons
who because of their taste for human flesh had withdrawn
from intercourse with their fellows, and who
appeared to possess a certain amount of magical power,
or at least sufficient to permit them to transform themselves
into animal shape at will. This they effected
by merely disrobing, by taking off a girdle made of
human skin, or putting on a similar belt of wolf-skin
(obviously a later substitute for an entire wolf-skin; in
some cases we hear of their donning the skin entire).
In other instances the body was rubbed with magic
ointment, or rain-water was drunk out of a wolf&rsquo;s
footprint. The brains of the animal were also eaten.
Olaus Magnus says that the were-wolves of Livonia
drained a cup of beer on initiation, and repeated certain
magical words. In order to throw off the wolf-shape
the animal girdle was removed, or else the magician
merely muttered certain formul&aelig;. In some instances the
transformation was supposed to be the work of Satan.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>The superstition regarding were-wolves seems to
have been exceedingly prevalent in France during the
sixteenth century, and there is evidence of numerous
trials of persons accused of were-wolfism, in some of
which it was clearly shown that murder and cannibalism
had taken place. Self-hallucination was accountable
for many of the cases, the supposed were-wolves declaring
that they had transformed themselves and had slain
many people. But about the beginning of the seventeenth
century native common sense came to the rescue,
and such confessions were not credited. In Teutonic
and Slavonic countries it was complained by men of
learning that the were-wolves did more damage than
real wild animals, and the existence of a regular &lsquo;college&rsquo;
or institution for the practice of the art of animal transformation
among were-wolves was affirmed.</p>
<p>Involuntary were-wolves, of which class Bisclaveret was
evidently a member, were often persons transformed
into animal shape because of the commission of sin,
and condemned to pass a certain number of years in
that form. Thus certain saints metamorphosed sinners
into wolves. In Armenia it was thought that a sinful
woman was condemned to pass seven years in the form
of a wolf. To such a woman a demon appeared, bringing
a wolf-skin. He commanded her to don it, and from
that moment she became a wolf, with all the nature of
the wild beast, devouring her own children and those
of strangers, and wandering forth at night, undeterred
by locks, bolts, or bars, returning only with the morning
to resume her human form.</p>
<p>In was, of course, in Europe, where the wolf was
one of the largest carnivorous animals, that the were-wolf
superstition chiefly gained currency. In Eastern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
countries, where similar beliefs prevailed, bears, tigers,
and other beasts of prey were substituted for the lupine
form of colder climes.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of Gugemar</i></h3>
<p>Oridial was one of the chief barons of King Arthur, and
dwelt in Brittany, where he held lands in fief of that
monarch. So deeply was he attached to his liege lord
that when his son Gugemar was yet a child he sent him
to Arthur&rsquo;s Court to be trained as a page. In due time
Arthur dubbed Gugemar knight and armed him in rich
harness, and the youth, hearing of war in Flanders, set
out for that realm in the hope of gaining distinction and
knightly honour.</p>
<p>After achieving many valorous deeds in Flanders
Gugemar felt a strong desire to behold his parents
once more, so, setting his face homeward, he journeyed
back to Brittany and dwelt with them for some time,
resting after his battles and telling his father, mother,
and sister Nogent of the many enterprises in which he
had been engaged. But he shortly grew weary of this
inactive existence, and in order to break the monotony
of it he planned a great hunt in the neighbouring
forest.</p>
<p>Early one morning he set out, and soon a tall stag was
roused from its bed among the ferns by the noise of the
hunters&rsquo; horns. The hounds were unleashed and the
entire hunt followed in pursuit, Gugemar the foremost
of all. But, closely as he pursued, the quarry eluded
the knight, and to his chagrin he was left alone in the
forest spaces with nothing to show for his long chase.
He was about to ride back in search of his companions
when on a sudden he noticed a doe hiding in a thicket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
with her fawn. She was white from ear to hoof,
without a spot. Gugemar&rsquo;s hounds, rushing at her,
held her at bay, and their master, fitting an arrow to
his bow, loosed the shaft at her so that she was
wounded above the hoof and brought to earth. But
the treacherous arrow, glancing, returned to Gugemar
and wounded him grievously in the thigh.</p>
<p>As he lay on the earth faint and with his senses almost
deserting him, Gugemar heard the doe speak to him in
human accents:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch who hast slain me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;think not to
escape my vengeance. Never shall leech nor herb nor
balm cure the wound which fate hath so justly inflicted
upon thee. Only canst thou be healed by a woman
who loves thee, and who for that love shall have to
suffer such woe and sorrow as never woman had to
endure before. Thou too shalt suffer equally with her,
and the sorrows of ye twain shall be the wonder of
lovers for all time. Leave me now to die in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gugemar was in sore dismay at hearing these words,
for never had he sought lady&rsquo;s love nor had he cared
for the converse of women. Winding his horn, he
succeeded in attracting one of his followers to the spot,
and sent him in search of his companions. When he
had gone Gugemar tore his linen shirt in pieces and
bound up his wound as well as he might. Then, dragging
himself most painfully into the saddle, he rode
from the scene of his misadventure at as great a pace
as his injury would permit of, for he had conceived
a plan which he did not desire should be interfered
with.</p>
<p>Riding at a hand-gallop, he soon came in sight of tall
cliffs which overlooked the sea, and which formed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
natural harbour, wherein lay a vessel richly beseen.
Its sails were of spun silk, and each plank and mast was
fashioned of ebony. Dismounting, Gugemar made his
way to the shore, and with much labour climbed upon
the ship. Neither mariner nor merchant was therein.
A large pavilion of silk covered part of the deck, and
within this was a rich bed, the work of the cunning
artificers of the days of King Solomon. It was
fashioned of cypress wood and ivory, and much gold
and many gems went to the making of it. The clothes
with which it was provided were fair and white as snow,
and so soft the pillow that he who laid his head upon
it, sad as he might be, could not resist sleep. The
pavilion was lit by two large waxen candles, set in
candlesticks of gold.</p>
<p>As the knight sat gazing at this splendid couch fit for a
king he suddenly became aware that the ship was moving
seaward. Already, indeed, he was far from land,
and at the sight he grew more sorrowful than before,
for his hurt made him helpless and he could not hope
either to guide the vessel or manage her so that he
might return to shore. Resigning himself to circumstances,
he lay down upon the ornate bed and sank into
a deep and dreamless slumber.</p>

GUGEMAR COMES UPON THE MAGIC SHIP<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>When he awoke he found to his intense surprise that
the ship had come to the port of an ancient city. Now
the king of this realm was an aged man who was
wedded to a young, fair lady, of whom he was, after the
manner of old men, intensely jealous. The castle of
this monarch frowned upon a fair garden enclosed from
the sea by a high wall of green marble, so that if one
desired to come to the castle he must do so from the
water. The place was straitly watched by vigilant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
warders, and within the wall so carefully defended lay
the Queen&rsquo;s bower, a fairer chamber than any beneath
the sun, and decorated with the most marvellous paintings.
Here dwelt the young Queen with one of her
ladies, her own sister&rsquo;s child, who was devoted to her
service and who never quitted her side. The key of
this bower was in the hands of an aged priest, who was
also the Queen&rsquo;s servitor.</p>
<p>One day on awaking from sleep the Queen walked in
the garden and espied a ship drawing near the land.
Suddenly, she knew not why, she grew very fearful,
and would have fled at the sight, but her maiden encouraged
her to remain. The vessel came to shore,
and the Queen&rsquo;s maiden entered it. No one could she
see on board except a knight sleeping soundly within
the pavilion, and he was so pale that she thought he
was dead. Returning to her mistress, she told her what
she had seen, and together they entered the vessel.</p>
<p>No sooner did the Queen behold Gugemar than she was
deeply smitten with love for him. In a transport of fear
lest he were dead she placed her hand upon his bosom,
and was overjoyed to feel the warmth of life within
him and that his heart beat strongly. At her touch
he awoke and courteously saluted her. She asked
him whence he came and to what nation he belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am a knight of Brittany. But
yesterday, or so it seems to me, for I may have
slumbered more than a day, I wounded a deer in the
forest, but the arrow with which I slew her rebounded
and struck me sorely. Then the beast, being, I trow,
a fairy deer, spake, saying that never would this wound
be healed save by one damsel in the whole world, and
her I know not where to find. Riding seaward, I came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
to where this ship lay moored, and, entering it, the
vessel drifted oceanward. I know not to what land I
have come, nor what name this city bears. I pray you,
fair lady, give me your best counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen listened to his tale with the deepest interest,
and when Gugemar made his appeal for aid and counsel
she replied: &ldquo;Truly, fair sir, I shall counsel you as best
I may. This city to which you have come belongs to
my husband, who is its King. Of much worship is he,
but stricken in years, and because of the jealousy he
bears me he has shut me up between these high walls.
If it please you you may tarry here awhile and we will
tend your wound until it be healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gugemar, wearied and bewildered at the strange things
which had happened to him in the space of a day,
thanked the Queen, and accepted her kind offer of
entertainment with alacrity. Between them the Queen
and her lady assisted him to leave the ship and bore
him to a chamber, where he was laid in a fair bed
and had his wound carefully dressed. When the ladies
had withdrawn and the knight was left to himself he
knew that he loved the Queen. All memory of his
home and even of his tormenting wound disappeared,
and he could brood only upon the fair face of the royal
lady who had so charmingly ministered to him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Queen was in little better case. All
night she could not sleep for pondering upon the handsome
youth who had come so mysteriously into her life,
and her maiden, seeing this, and marking how she
suffered, went to Gugemar&rsquo;s chamber and told him in
a frank and almost childlike manner how deeply her
mistress had been smitten with love for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are young,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so is my lady. Her lord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
is old and their union is unseemly. Heaven intended
you for one another and has brought you together in
its own good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly, after she had heard Mass, the Queen summoned
Gugemar into her presence. At first both were dumb
with confusion. At last his passion urged Gugemar to
speak, and his love-words came thick and fast. The
Queen hearkened to them, and, feeling that they rang
true, admitted that she loved him in return.</p>
<p>For a year and a half Gugemar dwelt in the Queen&rsquo;s
bower. Then the lovers met with misfortune.</p>
<p>For some days before the blow fell the Queen had
experienced a feeling of coming evil. So powerfully
did this affect her that she begged Gugemar for a
garment of his. The knight marvelled at the request,
and asked her playfully for what reason she desired such
a keepsake as a linen shift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if it chance that you leave me
or that we are separated I shall fear that some other
damsel may win your love. In this shift which you
give me I shall make a knot, and shall ask you to vow
that never will you give your love to dame or damsel
who cannot untie this knot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight complied with her request, and she made
such a cunning knot in the garment as only she could
unravel. For his part Gugemar gave the Queen a
wonderfully fashioned girdle which only he could unclasp,
and he begged her that she would never grant her love
to any man who could not free her from it. Each
promised the other solemnly to respect the vows they
had made.</p>
<p>That same day their hidden love was discovered. A
chamberlain of the King&rsquo;s observed them through a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
window of the Queen&rsquo;s bower, and, hastening to his
master, told him what he had seen. In terrible wrath the
King called for his guards, and, coming upon the lovers
unaware, commanded them to slay Gugemar at once.
But the knight seized upon a stout rod of fir-wood on
which linen was wont to be dried, and faced those who
would slay him so boldly that they fell back in dismay.</p>
<p>The King questioned him as to his name and lineage,
and Gugemar fearlessly related his story. The King
was incredulous at first, but said that could the ship
be found in which Gugemar had arrived he would
place him upon it and send him once more out to sea.
After search had been made the vessel was found,
and Gugemar was placed on it, the ship began to move,
and soon the knight was well at sea.</p>
<p>Ere long the ship came to that harbour whence she
had first sailed, and as Gugemar landed he saw to his
surprise one of his own vassals holding a charger and
accompanied by a knight. Mounting the steed, Gugemar
swiftly rode home, where he was received with
every demonstration of joy. But though his parents
and friends did everything possible to make him happy,
the memory of the fair Queen who had loved him
was ever with him night and day, so that he might
not be solaced by game or tilting, the chase or the
dance. In vain those who wished him well urged him
to take a wife. At first he roundly refused to consider
such a step, but when eagerly pressed by his friends
he announced that no wife should he wed who could
not first unloose the knot within his shift. So sought
after was Gugemar that all the damsels in Brittany
essayed the feat, but none of them succeeded and each
retired sorrowfully from the ordeal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>Meanwhile the aged King had set his wife in a tower
of grey marble, where she suffered agonies because of
the absence of her lover. Ever she wondered what
had happened to him, if he had regained his native
shore or whether he had been swallowed up by the
angry sea. Frequently she made loud moan, but there
were none to hear her cries save stony-hearted gaolers,
who were as dumb as the grey walls that enclosed her.</p>
<p>One day she chanced in her dolour to lean heavily
upon the door of her prison. To her amazement it
opened, and she found herself in the corridor without.
Hastening on impulse, and as if by instinct, to the
harbour, she found there her lover&rsquo;s ship. Quickly she
climbed upon its deck, and scarcely had she done so
than the vessel began to move seaward. In great fear
she sat still, and in time was wafted to a part of Brittany
governed by one named Meriadus, who was on the
point of going to war with a neighbouring chieftain.</p>
<p>From his window Meriadus had seen the approach of
the strange vessel, and, making his way to the seashore,
entered the ship. Struck with the beauty of the
Queen, he brought her to his castle, where he placed her
in his sister&rsquo;s chamber. He strove in every way to
dispel the sadness which seemed to envelop her like
a mantle, but despite his efforts to please her she
remained in sorrowful and doleful mood and would not
be comforted. Sorely did Meriadus press her to wed
him, but she would have none of him, and for answer
showed him the girdle round her waist, saying that
never would she give her love to any man who could
not unloose its buckle. As she said this Meriadus
seemed struck by her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a right worthy knight dwells in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
this land who will take no woman to his wife save she
who can first untie a certain crafty knot in his shift.
Well would I wager that it was you who tied this knot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Queen heard these words she well-nigh
fainted. Meriadus rushed to succour her, and gradually
she revived. Some days later Meriadus held a high
tournament, at which all the knights who were to aid
him in the war were to be present, among them Gugemar.
A festival was held on the night preceding the
tournament, at which Meriadus requested his sister
and the stranger dame to be present. As the Queen
entered the hall Gugemar rose from his place and
stared at her as at a vision of the dead. In great doubt
was he whether this lady was in truth his beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Gugemar,&rdquo; rallied Meriadus, &ldquo;let this damsel
try to unravel the knot in your shift which has puzzled
so many fair dames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gugemar called to his squire and bade him fetch the
shift, and when it was brought the lady, without seeming
effort, unravelled the knot. But even yet Gugemar
remained uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me, I pray you, whether or
not you wear a girdle with which I girt you in a realm
across the sea,&rdquo; and placing his hands around her
slender waist, he found there the secret belt.</p>
<p>All his doubts dispelled, Gugemar asked his loved one
how she had come to the tower of Meriadus. When he
had heard, he then and there requested his ally to yield
him the lady, but the chieftain roundly refused. Then
the knight in great anger cast down his glove and took
his departure, and, to the discomfiture of Meriadus, all
those knights who had gathered for the tournament and
had offered to assist Meriadus accompanied Gugemar.</p>

GUGEMAR&rsquo;S ASSAULT ON THE CASTLE OF MERIADUS<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>In a body they rode to the castle of the prince who was
at war with Meriadus, and next day they marched
against the discourteous chieftain. Long did they
besiege his castle, but at last when the defenders were
weak with hunger Gugemar and his men assailed the
place and took it, slaying Meriadus within the ruins of
his own hall. Gugemar, rushing to that place where
he knew his lady to be, called her forth, and in peace
brought her back with him to his own demesne, where
they were wed and dwelt long and happily.</p>
<p>There are several circumstances connected with this
beautiful old tale which deeply impress us with a belief
in its antiquity. The incident of the killing of the deer
and the incurable nature of Gugemar&rsquo;s wound are
undoubtedly legacies from very ancient times, when it
was believed to be unlucky under certain circumstances
to kill a beast of the chase. Some savage races, such as
the North American Indians, consider it to be most
unlucky to slay a deer without first propitiating the
great Deer God, the chief of the Deer Folk, and in fact
they attribute most of the ills to which flesh is heir to
the likelihood that they have omitted some of the very
involved ritual of the chase. It will be remembered that
Tristrem of Lyonesse also had an incurable wound, and
there are other like instances in romance and myth.</p>
<p>The vessel which carries Gugemar over the sea is
undoubtedly of the same class as those magic self-propelled
craft which we meet with very frequently in
Celtic lore, and the introduction of this feature in itself
is sufficient to convince us of the Celtic or Breton origin
of Marie&rsquo;s tale. We have such a craft in the Grail
legend in the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>, in which Galahad finds
precisely such a bed. The vessel in the Grail legend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
is described as &ldquo;King Solomon&rsquo;s Ship,&rdquo; and it is
obvious that Marie or her Breton original must have
borrowed the idea from a Grail source.</p>
<p>Lastly, the means adopted by the lovers to ensure one
another&rsquo;s constancy seem very like the methods of
taboo. The knot that may not or cannot be untied
has many counterparts in ancient lore, and the girdle
that no man but the accepted lover may loose is
reminiscent of the days when a man placed such a
girdle around his wife or sweetheart to signify his sole
possession of her. If a man could succeed in purloining
a mermaid&rsquo;s girdle she was completely in his power. So
is it with fairies in an Algonquin Indian tale. Even so
late as Crusading times many knights departing to fight
in the Holy Land bound a girdle round their ladies&rsquo;
waists in the hope that the gift would ensure their faithfulness.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of Laustic</i></h3>
<p>The Lay of Laustic, or the Nightingale, is purely of
Breton origin, and indeed is proved to be so by its title.
&ldquo;Laustic, I deem, men name it in that country&rdquo; (Brittany),
says Marie in her preface to the lay, &ldquo;which being interpreted
means <i>rossignol</i> in French and &lsquo;nightingale&rsquo; in
good plain English.&rdquo; She adds that the Breton harper
has already made a lay concerning it&mdash;added evidence
that the tale is of Celtic and not of French origin.</p>
<p>In the ancient town of Saint-Malo, in Brittany, dwelt
two knights whose valour and prowess brought much
fame to the community. Their houses were close to
one another, and one of them was married to a lady of
surpassing loveliness, while the other was a bachelor.
By insensible degrees the bachelor knight came to love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, and so handsome and gallant was
he that in time she returned his passion. He made
every possible excuse for seeking her society, and on
one pretext or another was constantly by her side. But
he was exceedingly careful of her fair fame, and acted
in such a way that not the slightest breath of scandal
could touch her.</p>
<p>Their houses were separated by an ancient stone wall
of considerable height, but the lovers could speak
together by leaning from their casements, and if this
was impossible they could communicate by sending
written messages. When the lady&rsquo;s husband was at
home she was guarded carefully, as was the custom
of the time, but nevertheless she contrived to greet her
lover from the window as frequently as she desired.</p>
<p>In due course the wondrous time of spring came round,
with white drift of blossom and stir of life newly
awakened. The short night hours grew warm, and
often did the lady arise from bed to have speech with
her lover at the casement. Her husband grew displeased
by her frequent absences, which disturbed his
rest, and wrathfully inquired the reason why she quitted
his side so often.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, husband,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I cannot rest because of
the sweet song of the nightingale, whose music has cast
a spell upon my heart. No tune of harp or viol can
compare with it, and I may not close my eyes so long as
his song continues in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the lady&rsquo;s husband, although a bold and hardy
knight, was malicious and ungenerous, and, disliking to
have his rest disturbed, resolved to deal summarily
with the nightingale. So he gave orders to his servants
to set traps in the garden and to smear every bough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
and branch with birdlime in order that the bird might
speedily be taken. His orders were at once carried
out, and the garden was filled with nets, while the cruel
lime glittered upon every tree. So complete were the
preparations of the serving-men that an unfortunate
nightingale which had made the garden its haunt and
had filled it with music for many a night while the lovers
talked was taken and brought to the knight.</p>
<p>Swiftly he bore the hapless bird to his wife&rsquo;s chamber,
his eyes sparkling with malicious glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your precious songster,&rdquo; he said, with bitter
irony. &ldquo;You will be happy to learn that you and I
may now spend our sleeping hours in peace since he is
taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, slay him not, my lord!&rdquo; she cried in anguish, for
she had grown to associate the bird&rsquo;s sweet song with
the sweeter converse of her lover&mdash;to regard it as in
a measure an accompaniment to his love-words. For
answer her husband seized the unhappy bird by the
neck and wrung its head off. Then he cast the little
body into the lap of the dame, soiling her with its
blood, and departed in high anger.</p>
<p>The lady pitifully raised what was left of the dead songster
and bitterly lamented over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Never again can I meet
with my lover at the casement, and he will believe that
I am faithless to him. But I shall devise some means
to let him know that this is not so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having considered as to what she should do, the lady
took a fine piece of white samite, broidered with gold,
and worked upon it as on a tapestry the whole story of
the nightingale, so that her knight might not be ignorant
of the nature of the barrier that had arisen between them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>In this silken shroud she wrapped the small, sad body
of the slain bird and gave it in charge of a trusty
servant to bear to her lover. The messenger told the
knight what had occurred. The news was heavy to
him, but now, having insight to the vengeful nature of
her husband, he feared to jeopardize the lady&rsquo;s safety,
so he remained silent. But he caused a rich coffer to
be made in fine gold, set with precious stones, in which
he laid the body of the nightingale, and this small
funeral urn he carried about with him on all occasions,
nor could any circumstance hinder him from keeping it
constantly beside him.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<p>To carry next my heart. Love&rsquo;s fire is out,</p>
<p>And these poor embers grey, but I am loath</p>

<p>His relics over that they did consume.</p>

<h3><i>The Lay of Eliduc</i></h3>
<p>In the tale of Eliduc we have in all probability a
genuine product of native Breton romance. So at
least avers Marie, who assures us that it is &ldquo;a very
ancient Breton lay,&rdquo; and we have no reason to doubt
her word, seeing that, had she been prone to literary
dishonesty, it would have been much easier for her to
have passed off the tale as her own original conception.
There is, of course, the probability that it was so widely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
known in its Breton version that to have done so
would have been to have openly courted the charge
of plagiarism&mdash;an impeachment which it is not possible
to bring against this most charming and delightful
poetess.</p>
<p>Eliduc, a knight of Brittany, was happy in the confidence
of his King, who, when affairs of State caused
his absence from the realm, left his trusted adherent
behind him as viceroy and regent. Such a man,
staunch and loyal, could scarcely be without enemies,
and the harmless pleasure he took in the chase during
the King&rsquo;s absence was construed by evil counsellors
on the monarch&rsquo;s return as an unwarranted licence with
the royal rights of venery. The enemies of Eliduc so
harped upon the knight&rsquo;s supposed lack of reverence
for the royal authority that at length the King&rsquo;s patience
gave way and in an outburst of wrath he gave orders
for Eliduc&rsquo;s banishment, without vouchsafing his former
friend and confidant the least explanation of this petulant
action.</p>
<p>Dismayed by the sudden change in his fortunes, Eliduc
returned to his house, and there acquainted his friends
and vassals with the King&rsquo;s unjust decree. He told
them that it was his intention to cross the sea to the
kingdom of Logres, to sojourn there for a space. He
placed his estates in the hands of his wife and begged
of his vassals that they would serve her loyally. Then,
having settled his affairs, he took ten knights of his
household and started upon his journey. His wife,
Guildeluec, accompanied him for several miles, and on
parting they pledged good faith to one another.</p>
<p>In due time the cavalcade came to the seashore and
took ship for the realm of Logres. Near Exeter, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
this land, dwelt an aged king who had for his heir a
daughter called Guillardun. This damsel had been
asked in marriage by a neighbouring prince, and as
her father had refused to listen to his proposals the
disappointed suitor made war upon him, spoiling and
wasting his land. The old King, fearful for his child&rsquo;s
safety, had shut her up in a strong castle for her
better security and his own peace of mind.</p>
<p>Now Eliduc, coming to that land, heard the tale of
the quarrel between the King and his neighbour, and
considered as to which side he should take. After
due deliberation he arranged to fight on the side of the
King, with whom he offered to take service. His offer
was gratefully accepted, and he had not been long in
the royal host when he had an opportunity of distinguishing
himself. The town wherein he was lodged
with his knights was attacked by the enemy. He set
his men in ambush in a forest track by which it was
known the enemy would approach the town, and succeeded
in routing them and in taking large numbers
of prisoners and much booty. This feat of arms raised
him high in the estimation of the King, who showed
him much favour, and the Princess, hearing of his
fame, became very desirous of beholding him. She
sent her chamberlain to Eliduc saying that she wished
to hear the story of his deeds, and he, quite as anxious
to see the imprisoned Princess of whom he had heard
so much, set out at once. On beholding each other
they experienced deep agitation. Eliduc thought that
never had he seen so beautiful and graceful a maiden,
and Guillardun that this was the most handsome and
comely knight she had ever met.</p>
<p>For a long time they spoke together, and then Eliduc
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
took his leave and departed. He counted all the time
lost that he had remained in the kingdom without
knowing this lady, but he promised himself that now
he would frequently seek her society. Then, with a
pang of remorse, he thought of his good and faithful
wife and the sacred promise he had made her.</p>
<p>Guillardun, on her part, was none the less ill at ease.
She passed a restless night, and in the morning confided
her case to her aged chamberlain, who was almost
a second father to her, and he, all unwitting that Eliduc
was already bound in wedlock to another, suggested
that the Princess should send the knight a love-token
to discover by the manner in which he received it
whether or not her love was returned. Guillardun took
this advice, and sent her lover a girdle and a ring by
the hands of the chamberlain. On receiving the token
Eliduc showed the greatest joy, girded the belt about
his middle, and placed the ring on his finger. The
chamberlain returned to the Princess and told her with
what evident satisfaction Eliduc had received the gifts.
But the Princess in her eagerness showered questions
upon him, until at last the old man grew impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, somewhat testily, &ldquo;I have told you the
knight&rsquo;s words; I cannot tell you his thoughts, for he is
a prudent gentleman who knows well what to hide in
his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he rejoiced at the gifts Eliduc had but little
peace of mind. He could think of nothing save the
vow he had made to his wife before he left her. But
thoughts of the Princess would intrude themselves upon
him. Often he saw Guillardun, and although he saluted
her with a kiss, as was the custom of the time, he never
spoke a single word of love to her, being fearful on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
one hand of breaking his conjugal vow and on the other
of offending the King.</p>
<p>One evening when Eliduc was announced the King was
in his daughter&rsquo;s chamber, playing at chess with a
stranger lord. He welcomed the knight heartily, and
much to the embarrassment of the lovers begged his
daughter to cherish a closer friendship for Eliduc, whom
he brought to her notice as a right worthy knight. The
pair withdrew somewhat from the others, as if for the
purpose of furthering the friendship which the old King
so ardently seemed to desire, and Eliduc thanked the
Princess for the gifts she had sent him by the chamberlain.
Then the Princess, taking advantage of her rank,
told Eliduc that she desired him for her husband, and
that, did he refuse her, she would die unwed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;I have great joy in your
love, but have you thought that I may not always tarry
in this land? I am your father&rsquo;s man until this war
hath an end. Then shall I return unto mine own
country.&rdquo; But Guillardun, in a transport of love, told
him she would trust him entirely with her heart, and
passing great was the affection that grew between them.</p>
<p>Eliduc, in spite of his love for the Princess, had by no
means permitted his conduct of the war to flag. Indeed,
if anything, he redoubled his efforts, and pressed the
foe so fiercely that at length he was forced to submit.
And now news came to him that his old master, the
King who had banished him from Brittany, was sore
bestead by an enemy and was searching for his former
vice-regent on every hand, who was so mighty a knight
in the field and so sage at the council-board. Turning
upon the false lords who had spoken evil of his favourite,
he outlawed them from the land for ever. He sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
messengers east and west and across the seas in search
of Eliduc, who when he heard the news was much dismayed,
so greatly did he love Guillardun. These twain
had loved with a pure and tender passion, and never by
word or deed had they sullied the affection they bore
one another. Dearly did the Princess hope that Eliduc
might remain in her land and become her lord, and little
did she dream that he was wedded to a wife across the
seas. For his part Eliduc took close counsel with
himself. He knew by reason of the fealty he owed to
his King that he must return to Brittany, but he was
equally aware that if he parted from Guillardun one or
other of them must die.</p>
<p>Deep was the chagrin of the King of Logres when he
learned that Eliduc must depart from his realm, but
deeper far was his daughter&rsquo;s grief when the knight
came to bid her farewell. In moving words she urged
him to remain, and when she found that his loyalty was
proof even against his love, she begged of him to take
her with him to Brittany. But this request he turned
aside, on the plea that as he had served her father he
could not so offend him as by the theft of his daughter.
He promised, however, by all he held most dear that he
would return one day, and with much sorrow the two
parted, exchanging rings for remembrance.</p>
<p>Eliduc took ship and swiftly crossed the sea. He met
with a joyous reception from his King, and none was
so glad at his return as his wife. But gradually his
lady began to see that he had turned cold to her. She
charged him with it, and he replied that he had pledged
his faith to the foreign lord whom he had served
abroad.</p>
<p>Very soon through his conduct the war was brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
to a victorious close, and almost immediately thereafter
Eliduc repaired across the sea to Logres, taking with
him two of his nephews as his squires. On reaching
Logres he at once went to visit Guillardun, who
received him with great gladness. She returned with
him to his ship, which commenced the return voyage
at once, but when they neared the dangerous coast
of Brittany a sudden tempest arose, and waxed so
fierce that the mariners lost all hope of safety. One
of them cried out that the presence of Guillardun on
board the ship endangered all their lives and that the
conduct of Eliduc, who had already a faithful wife, in
seeking to wed this foreign woman had brought about
their present dangerous position. Eliduc grew very
wroth, and when Guillardun heard that her knight was
already wedded she swooned and all regarded her as
dead. In despair Eliduc fell upon his betrayer, slew
him, and cast his body into the sea. Then, guiding
the ship with a seaman&rsquo;s skill, he brought her into
harbour.</p>
<p>When they were safely anchored, Eliduc conceived the
idea of taking Guillardun, whom he regarded as dead,
to a certain chapel in a great forest quite near his own
home. Setting her body before him on his palfrey,
he soon came to the little shrine, and making a bier
of the altar laid Guillardun upon it. He then betook
him to his own house, but the next morning returned
to the chapel in the forest. Mourning over the body
of his lady-love, he was surprised to observe that the
colour still remained in her cheeks and lips. Again
and again he visited the chapel, and his wife, marvelling
whither he went, bribed a varlet to discover the object
of his repeated absences. The man watched Eliduc
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
and saw him enter the chapel and mourn over the body
of Guillardun, and, returning, acquainted his lady with
what he had seen.</p>
<p>Guildeluec&mdash;for such, we will remember, was the name
of Eliduc&rsquo;s wife&mdash;set out for the shrine, and with
astonishment beheld the lifelike form of Guillardun laid
on the altar. So pitiful was the sight that she herself
could not refrain from the deepest sorrow. As she sat
weeping a weasel came from under the altar and ran
across Guillardun&rsquo;s body, and the varlet who attended
Guildeluec struck at it with his staff and killed it.
Another weasel issued, and, beholding its dead comrade,
went forth from the chapel and hastened to the wood,
whence it returned, bearing in its mouth a red flower,
which it placed on the mouth of its dead companion.
The weasel which Guildeluec had believed to be dead
at once stood up. Beholding this, the varlet cast his
staff at the animals and they sped away, leaving the
red flower behind them.</p>

ELIDUC CARRIES GUILLARDUN TO THE FOREST CHAPEL<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Guildeluec immediately picked the flower up, and returning
with it to the altar where Guillardun lay, placed
it on the maiden&rsquo;s mouth. In a few moments she heard
a sigh, and Guillardun sat up, and inquired if she had
slept long. Guildeluec asked her name and degree,
and Guillardun in reply acquainted her with her history
and lineage, speaking very bitterly of Eliduc, who, she
said, had betrayed her in a strange land. Guildeluec
declared herself the wife of Eliduc, told Guillardun
how deeply the knight had grieved for her, and declared
her intention of taking the veil and releasing Eliduc
from his marriage vow. She conducted Guillardun to
her home, where they met Eliduc, who rejoiced greatly
at the restoration of his lady-love. His wife founded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
a convent with the rich portion he bestowed upon her,
and Eliduc, in thankfulness for Guillardun&rsquo;s recovery,
built a fair church close by his castle and endowed
it bountifully, and close beside it erected a great
monastery. Later Guillardun entered the convent of
which Guildeluec was the abbess, and Eliduc, himself
feeling the call of the holy life, devoted himself to the
service of God in the monastery. Messages passed
between convent and monastery in which Eliduc and
the holy women encouraged each other in the pious
life which they had chosen, and by degrees the three
who had suffered so greatly came to regard their
seclusion as far preferable to the world and all its
vanities.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of Equitan</i></h3>
<p>The Lay of Equitan is one of Marie&rsquo;s most famous tales.
Equitan was King of Nantes, in Brittany, and led the
life of a pleasure-seeker. To win approval from the
eyes of fair ladies was more to him than knightly fame
or honour.</p>
<p>Equitan had as seneschal a trusty and faithful knight,
who was to the pleasure-loving seigneur as his right
hand. This faithful servant was also captain of
Equitan&rsquo;s army, and sat as a judge in his courts. To
his undoing he had a wife, as fair a dame as any in
the duchy of Brittany. &ldquo;Her eyes,&rdquo; says the old lay,
&ldquo;were blue, her face was warm in colour, her mouth
fragrant and her nose dainty.&rdquo; She was ever tastefully
dressed and courtly in demeanour, and soon attracted
the attention of such an admirer of the fair sex as
Equitan, who desired to speak with her more intimately.
He therefore, as a subterfuge, announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
that a great hunt would take place in that part of his
domains in which his seneschal&rsquo;s castle was situated,
and this gave him the opportunity of sojourning at the
castle and holding converse with the lady, with whom
he became so charmed that in a few days he fell deeply
in love with her. On the night of the day when he first
became aware that he loved her Equitan lay tossing on
his bed, in a torment of fiery emotion. He debated
with himself in what manner he should convey to his
seneschal&rsquo;s wife the fact that he loved her, and at length
prepared a plot which he thought would be likely to
succeed.</p>
<p>Next day he rose as usual and made all arrangements
to proceed with the chase. But shortly after setting
out he returned, pleading that he had fallen sick, and
took to his bed. The faithful seneschal could not divine
what had occurred to render his lord so seriously indisposed
as he appeared to be, and requested his wife to
go to him to see if she could minister to him and cheer
his drooping spirits.</p>
<p>The lady went to Equitan, who received her dolefully
enough. He told her without reserve that the malady
from which he suffered was none other than love for
herself, and that did she not consent to love him in
return he would surely die. The dame at first dissented,
but, carried away by the fiery eloquence of his words,
she at last assured him of her love, and they exchanged
rings as a token of troth and trust.</p>
<p>The love of Equitan and the seneschal&rsquo;s wife was
discovered by none, and when they desired to meet
he arranged to go hunting in the neighbourhood of
the seneschal&rsquo;s castle. Shortly after they had plighted
their troth the great barons of the realm approached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
the King with a proposal that he should marry, but
Equitan would have none of this, nor would he listen
to even his most trusted advisers with regard to such
a subject. The nobles were angered at his curt and
even savage refusal to hearken to them, and the
commons were also greatly disturbed because of the
lack of a successor. The echoes of the disagreement
reached the ears of the seneschal&rsquo;s wife, who was much
perturbed thereby, being aware that the King had come
to this decision for love of her.</p>
<p>At their next meeting she broached the subject to her
royal lover, lamenting that they had ever met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now are my good days gone,&rdquo; she said, weeping, &ldquo;for
you will wed some king&rsquo;s daughter as all men say, and
I shall certainly die if I lose you thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, that will not be,&rdquo; replied Equitan. &ldquo;Never
shall I wed except your husband die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady felt that he spoke truly, but in an evil moment
she came to attach a sinister meaning to the words
Equitan had employed regarding her husband. Day
and night she brooded on them, for well she knew that
did her husband die Equitan would surely wed her. By
insensible degrees she came to regard her husband&rsquo;s
death as a good rather than an evil thing, and little by
little Equitan, who at first looked upon the idea with
horror, became converted to her opinion. Between
them they hatched a plot for the undoing of the
seneschal. It was arranged that the King should go
hunting as usual in the neighbourhood of his faithful
servant&rsquo;s castle. While lodging in the castle, the King
and the seneschal would be bled in the old surgical
manner for their health&rsquo;s sake, and three days after
would bathe before leaving the chamber they occupied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
and the heartless wife suggested that she should make
her husband&rsquo;s bath so fiercely hot that he would not
survive after entering it. One would think that the
seneschal would easily have been able to escape such a
simple trap, but we must remember that the baths of
Norman times were not shaped like our own, but were
exceedingly deep, and indeed some of them were in
form almost like those immense upright jars such as the
forty thieves were concealed in in the story of Ali Baba,
so that in many cases it was not easy for the bather to
tell whether the water into which he was stepping was
hot or otherwise.</p>
<p>The plot was carried out as the lady had directed, but
not without much misgiving on the part of Equitan.
The King duly arrived at the castle, and announced his
intention to be bled, requesting that the seneschal should
undergo the same operation at the same time, and occupy
the same chamber by way of companionship. Then
after the leech had bled them the King asked that he
might have a bath before leaving his apartment, and
the seneschal requested that his too should be made
ready. Accordingly on the third day the baths were
brought to the chamber, and the lady occupied herself
with filling them. While she was doing so her lord left
the chamber for a space, and during his absence the King
and the lady were clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms. So
rapt were the pair in their amorous dalliance that they
failed to notice the return of the seneschal, who, when
he saw them thus engaged, uttered an exclamation of
surprise and wrath. Equitan, turning quickly, saw him,
and with a cry of despair leapt into the bath that the
lady had prepared for the seneschal, and there perished
miserably, while the enraged husband, seizing his faithless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
wife, thrust her headlong into the boiling water
beside her lover, where she too was scalded to death.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of the Ash-Tree</i></h3>
<p>In olden times there dwelt in Brittany two knights who
were neighbours and close friends. Both were married,
and one was the father of twin sons, one of whom he
christened by the name of his friend. Now this friend
had a wife who was envious of heart and rancorous of
tongue, and on hearing that two sons had been born to
her neighbour she spoke slightingly and cruelly about
her, saying that to bear twins was ever a disgrace. Her
evil words were spread abroad, and at last as a result of
her malicious speech the good lady&rsquo;s husband himself
began to doubt and suspect the wife who had never for
a moment given him the least occasion to do so.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, within the year two daughters were
born to the lady of the slanderous tongue, who now
deeply lamented the wrong she had done, but all to no
purpose. Fearful of the gossip which she thought the
event would occasion, she gave one of the children to
a faithful handmaiden, with directions that it should be
laid on the steps of a church, where it might be picked
up as a foundling and nourished by some stranger. The
babe was wrapped in a linen cloth, which again was
covered with a beautiful piece of red silk that the lady&rsquo;s
husband had purchased in the East, and a handsome
ring engraved with the family insignia and set with
garnets was bound to the infant&rsquo;s arm with silken lace.
When the child had thus been attired the damsel took
it and carried it for many miles into the country, until
at last she came to a city where there was a large and
fair abbey. Breathing a prayer that the child might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
have proper guardianship, the girl placed it on the abbey
steps as her mistress had ordered her to do, but, afraid
that it might catch cold on such a chilly bed, she looked
around and saw an ash-tree, thick and leafy, with four
strong branches, among the foliage of which she deposited
the little one, commending it to the care of God, after
which she returned to her mistress and acquainted her
with what had passed.</p>
<p>In the morning the abbey porter opened the great doors
of the house of God so that the people might enter for
early Mass. As he was thus engaged his eye caught
the gleam of red silk among the leaves of the ash-tree,
and going to it he discovered the deserted infant.
Taking the babe from its resting-place, he returned
with it to his house, and, awaking his daughter, who
was a widow with a baby yet in the cradle, he asked
her to cherish it and care for it. Both father and
daughter could see from the crimson silk and the great
signet ring that the child was of noble birth. The
porter told the abbess of his discovery, and she requested
him to bring the child to her, dressed precisely as it had
been found. On beholding the infant a great compassion
was aroused in the breast of the holy woman, who
resolved to bring up the child herself, calling her her
niece, and since she was taken from the ash giving her
the name of FrÃªne.</p>
<p>FrÃªne grew up one of the fairest damsels in Brittany.
She was frank in manner, yet modest and discreet in
bearing and speech. At Dol, where, as we have read,
there is a great menhir and other prehistoric monuments,
there lived a lord called Buron, who, hearing reports of
FrÃªne&rsquo;s beauty and sweetness, greatly desired to behold
her. Riding home from a tournament, he passed near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
the convent, and, alighting there, paid his respects to
the abbess, and begged that he might see her niece.
Buron at once fell in love with the maiden, and in order
to gain favour with the abbess bestowed great riches
upon the establishment over which she presided, requesting
in return that he might be permitted to occupy
a small apartment in the abbey should he chance to be
in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In this way he frequently saw and spoke with FrÃªne,
who in turn fell in love with him. He persuaded her
to fly with him to his castle, taking with her the silken
cloth and ring with which she had been found.</p>
<p>But the lord&rsquo;s tenants were desirous that he should
marry, and had set their hearts upon his union with a
rich lady named Coudre, daughter of a neighbouring
baron. The marriage was arranged, greatly to the grief
of FrÃªne, and duly took place. Going to Buron&rsquo;s bridal
chamber, she considered it too mean, blinded with love
as she was, for such as he, and placed the wondrous
piece of crimson silk in which she had been wrapped
as an infant over the coverlet. Presently the bride&rsquo;s
mother entered the bridal chamber in order to see that
all was fitting for her daughter&rsquo;s reception there. Gazing
at the crimson coverlet, she recognized it as that in
which she had wrapped her infant daughter. She
anxiously inquired to whom it belonged, and was told
that it was FrÃªne&rsquo;s. Going to the damsel, she questioned
her as to where she had obtained the silk, and was told
by FrÃªne that the abbess had given it to her along with
a ring which had been found upon her when, as an
infant, she had been discovered within the branches of
the ash-tree.</p>
<p>The mother asked anxiously to see the ring, and on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
beholding it told FrÃªne of their relationship, which at
the same time she confessed to her husband, the baron.
The father was overjoyed to meet with a daughter he
had never known, and hastened to the bridegroom to
acquaint him with FrÃªne&rsquo;s story. Great joy had Buron,
and the archbishop who had joined him to Coudre gave
counsel that they should be parted according to the
rites of the Church and that Buron should marry FrÃªne.
This was accordingly done, and when FrÃªne&rsquo;s parents
returned to their own domain they found another
husband for Coudre.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of Graelent</i></h3>
<p>Graelent was a Breton knight dwelling at the Court
of the King of Brittany, a very pillar to him in war,
bearing himself valiantly in tourney and joust. So
handsome and brave was he that the Queen fell madly
in love with him, and asked her chamberlain to bring
the knight into her presence. When he came she
praised him greatly to his face, not only for his gallantry
in battle, but also for his comeliness; but at her honeyed
words the youth, quite abashed, sat silent, saying
nothing. The Queen at last questioned him if his
heart was set on any maid or dame, to which he replied
that it was not, that love was a serious business
and not to be taken in jest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many speak glibly of love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of whom not
one can spell the first letter of its name. Love should
be quiet and discreet or it is nothing worth, and without
accord between the lovers love is but a bond and
a constraint. Love is too high a matter for me to
meddle with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen listened greedily to Graelent&rsquo;s words, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
when he had finished speaking she discovered her love
for him; but he turned from her courteously but firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I beg your forgiveness, but this
may not be. I am the King&rsquo;s man, and to him I have
pledged my faith and loyalty. Never shall he know
shame through any conduct of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he took his leave of the Queen. But
his protestations had altered her mind not at all. She
sent him messages daily, and costly gifts, but these he
refused and returned, till at last the royal dame, stung
to anger by his repulses, conceived a violent hatred
for him, and resolved to be revenged upon him for the
manner in which he had scorned her love.</p>
<p>The King of Brittany went to war with a neighbouring
monarch, and Graelent bore himself manfully in the
conflict, leading his troops again and again to victory.
Hearing of his repeated successes, the Queen was exceedingly
mortified, and made up her mind to destroy
his popularity with the troops. With this end in view
she prevailed upon the King to withhold the soldiers&rsquo;
pay, which Graelent had to advance them out of his
own means. In the end the unfortunate knight was
reduced almost to beggary by this mean stratagem.</p>
<p>One morning he was riding through the town where
he was lodged, clad in garments so shabby that the
wealthy burgesses in their fur-lined cloaks and rich
apparel gibed and jeered at him, but Graelent, sure of
his own worth, deigned not to take notice of such ill-breeding,
and for his solace quitted the crowded streets
of the place and took his way toward the great forest
which skirted it. He rode into its gloom deep in
thought, listening to the murmur of the river which
flowed through the leafy ways.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>He had not gone far when he espied a white hart within
a thicket. She fled before him into the thickest part of
the forest, but the silvern glimmer of her body showed
the track she had taken. On a sudden deer and horseman
dashed into a clearing among the trees where there
was a grassy lawn, in the midst of which sprang a fountain
of clear water. In this fountain a lady was bathing, and
two attendant maidens stood near. Now Graelent believed
that the lady must be a fairy, and knowing well
that the only way to capture such a being was to seize
her garments, he looked around for these, and seeing
them lying upon a bush he laid hands upon them.</p>
<p>The attendant women at this set up a loud outcry, and
the lady herself turned to where he sat his horse and
called him by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Graelent, what do you hope to gain by the theft of my
raiment?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have you, a knight, sunk so
low as to behave like a common pilferer? Take my
mantle if you must, but pray spare me my gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graelent laughed at the lady&rsquo;s angry words, and told
her that he was no huckster. He then begged her to
don her garments, as he desired to have speech with
her. After her women had attired her, Graelent took
her by the hand and, leading her a little space away
from her attendants, told her that he had fallen deeply
in love with her. But the lady frowned and seemed at
first offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know to whom you proffer your love,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Are you aware that my birth and lineage render
it an impertinence for a mere knight to seek to ally
himself with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Graelent had a most persuasive tongue, and the
deep love he had conceived for the lady rendered him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
doubly eloquent on this occasion. At last the fairy-woman,
for such she was, was quite carried away by his
words, and granted him the boon he craved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, however, one promise I must exact from
you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that is that never shall you mention
me to mortal man. I on my part shall assist you in
every possible manner. You shall never be without
gold in your purse nor costly apparel to wear. Day
and night shall I remain with you, and in war and in
the chase will ride by your side, visible to you alone,
unseen by your companions. For a year must you
remain in this country. Now noon has passed and you
must go. A messenger shall shortly come to you to
tell you of my wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graelent took leave of the lady and kissed her farewell.
Returning to his lodgings in the town, he was leaning
from the casement considering his strange adventure
when he saw a varlet issuing from the forest riding
upon a palfrey. The man rode up the cobbled street
straight to Graelent&rsquo;s lodgings, where he dismounted
and, entering, told the knight that his lady had sent
him with the palfrey as a present, and begged that he
would accept the services of her messenger to take charge
of his lodgings and manage his affairs.</p>
<p>The serving-man quickly altered the rather poor appearance
of Graelent&rsquo;s apartment. He spread a rich coverlet
upon his couch and produced a well-filled purse and rich
apparel. Graelent at once sought out all the poor
knights of the town and feasted them to their hearts&rsquo;
content. From this moment he fared sumptuously
every day. His lady appeared whenever he desired
her to, and great was the love between them. Nothing
more had he to wish for in this life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>A year passed in perfect happiness for the knight, and
at its termination the King held a great feast on the
occasion of Pentecost. To this feast Sir Graelent was
bidden. All day the knights and barons and their ladies
feasted, and the King, having drunk much wine, grew
boastful. Requesting the Queen to stand forth on the
daÃ¯s, he asked the assembled nobles if they had ever
beheld so fair a dame as she. The lords were loud in
their praise of the Queen, save Graelent only. He sat
with bent head, smiling strangely, for he knew of a lady
fairer by far than any lady in that Court. The Queen
was quick to notice this seeming discourtesy, and pointed
it out to the King, who summoned Graelent to the steps
of the throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;wherefore
did you sneer when all other men praised the Queen&rsquo;s
beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Graelent, &ldquo;you do yourself much dishonour
by such a deed. You make your wife a show
upon a stage and force your nobles to praise her with
lies when in truth a fairer dame than she could very
easily be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when she heard this the Queen was greatly
angered and prayed her husband to compel Graelent to
bring to the Court her of whom he boasted so proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set us side by side,&rdquo; cried the infuriated Queen, &ldquo;and
if she be fairer than I before men&rsquo;s eyes, Graelent may
go in peace, but if not let justice be done upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, stirred to anger at these words, ordered his
guards to seize Graelent, swearing that he should never
issue from prison till the lady of whom he had boasted
should come to Court and pit herself against the Queen.
Graelent was then cast into a dungeon, but he thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
little of this indignity, fearing much more that his rashness
had broken the bond betwixt him and his fairy
bride. After a while he was set at liberty, on pledging
his word that he would return bringing with him the
lady whom he claimed as fairer than the Queen.</p>
<p>Leaving the Court, he betook himself to his lodging,
and called upon his lady, but received no answer.
Again he called, but without result, and believing that
his fairy bride had utterly abandoned him he gave way
to despair. In a year&rsquo;s time Graelent returned to the
Court and admitted his failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Graelent,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;wherefore should you
not be punished? You have slandered the Queen in
the most unknightly manner, and given the lie to those
nobles who must now give judgment against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nobles retired to consider their judgment upon
Graelent. For a long time they debated, for most of
them were friendly to him and he had been extremely
popular at Court. In the midst of their deliberations
a page entered and prayed them to postpone judgment,
as two damsels had arrived at the palace and were
having speech with the King concerning Graelent.
The damsels told the King that their mistress was at
hand, and begged him to wait for her arrival, as she had
come to uphold Graelent&rsquo;s challenge. Hearing this, the
Queen quitted the hall, and shortly after she had gone
a second pair of damsels appeared bearing a similar
message for the King. Lastly Graelent&rsquo;s young bride
herself entered the hall.</p>
<p>At sight of her a cry of admiration arose from the
assembled nobles, and all admitted that their eyes had
never beheld a fairer lady. When she reached the
King&rsquo;s side she dismounted from her palfrey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; she said, addressing the King, &ldquo;hasty and foolish
was Graelent&rsquo;s tongue when he spoke as he did, but at
least he told the truth when he said that there is no
lady so fair but a fairer may be found. Look upon me
and judge in this quarrel between the Queen and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had spoken every lord and noble with one
voice agreed that she was fairer than her royal rival.
Even the King himself admitted that it was so, and
Sir Graelent was declared a free man.</p>
<p>Turning round to seek his lady, the knight observed
that she was already some distance away, so, mounting
upon his white steed, he followed hotly after her. All
day he followed, and all night, calling after her and
pleading for pity and pardon, but neither she nor her
attendant damsels paid the slightest attention to his
cries. Day after day he followed her, but to no purpose.</p>
<p>At last the lady and her maidens entered the forest and
rode to the bank of a broad stream. They set their
horses to the river, but when the lady saw that Graelent
was about to follow them she turned and begged him to
desist, telling him that it was death for him to cross that
stream. Graelent did not heed her, but plunged into
the torrent. The stream was deep and rapid, and
presently he was torn from his saddle. Seeing this, the
lady&rsquo;s attendants begged her to save him. Turning
back, the lady clutched her lover by the belt and dragged
him to the shore. He was well-nigh drowned, but under
her care he speedily recovered, and, say the Breton folk,
entered with her that realm of Fairyland into which
penetrated Thomas the Rhymer, Ogier the Dane, and
other heroes. His white steed when it escaped from
the river grieved greatly for its master, rushing up and
down the bank, neighing loudly, and pawing with its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
hoofs upon the ground. Many men coveted so noble a
charger, and tried to capture him, but all in vain, so
each year, &ldquo;in its season,&rdquo; as the old romance says, the
forest is filled with the sorrowful neighing of the good
steed which may not find its master.</p>
<p>The story of Graelent is one of those which deal with
what is known to folk-lorists as the &lsquo;fairy-wife&rsquo; subject.
A taboo is always placed upon the mortal bridegroom.
Sometimes he must not utter the name of his wife; in
other tales, as in that of Melusine, he must not seek
her on a certain day of the week. The essence of the
story is, of course, that the taboo is broken, and in most
cases the mortal husband loses his supernatural mate.</p>
<p>Another incident in the general <i>motif</i> is the stealing
of the fairy-woman&rsquo;s clothes. The idea is the same as
that found in stories where the fisherman steals the
sea-woman&rsquo;s skin canoe as a prelude to making her
his wife, or the feather cloak of the swan-maiden is
seized by the hunter when he finds her asleep, thus
placing the supernatural maiden in his power. Among
savages it is quite a common and usual circumstance
for the spouses not to mention each other&rsquo;s names for
months after marriage, nor even to see one another&rsquo;s
faces. In the story under consideration the taboo consists
in the mortal bridegroom being forbidden to allude
in any circumstances to his supernatural wife, who is
undoubtedly the same type of being encountered by
Thomas the Rhymer and Bonny Kilmeny in the ballads
related of them. They are denizens of a country, a
fairy realm, which figures partly as an abode of the
dead, and which we are certainly justified in identifying
with the Celtic Otherworld. The river which the fairy-woman
crosses bears a certain resemblance to the Styx,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
or she tells Graelent plainly that should he reach its
opposite bank he is as good as dead. Fairyland in
early Celtic lore may be a place of delight, but it is
none the less one of death and remoteness.</p>
<h3><i>The Lay of the Dolorous Knight</i></h3>
<p>Once more the scene is laid in Nantes, and &ldquo;some
harpers,&rdquo; says Marie, &ldquo;call it the Lay of the Four
Sorrows.&rdquo; In this city of Brittany dwelt a lady on
whom four barons of great worship had set their love.
They were not singular in this respect, as the damsel&rsquo;s
bright eyes had set fire to the hearts of all the youths
of the ancient town. She smiled upon them all, but
favoured no one more than another. Out of this great
company, however, the four noblemen in question had
constituted themselves her particular squires. They
vied with one another in the most earnest manner to
gain her esteem; but she was equally gracious to all
and it was impossible to say that she favoured any.</p>
<p>It was not surprising, then, that each one of the four
nobles believed that the lady preferred him to the
others. Each of them had received gifts from her,
and each cried her name at tournaments. On the
occasion of a great jousting, held without the walls
of Nantes, the four lovers held the lists, and from all
the surrounding realms and duchies came hardy knights
to break a spear for the sake of chivalry.</p>
<p>From matins to vespers the friendly strife raged fiercely,
and against the four champions of Nantes four foreign
knights especially pitted themselves. Two of these
were of Hainault, and the other two were Flemings.
The two companies charged each other so desperately
that the horses of all eight men were overthrown. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
four knights of Nantes rose lightly from the ground,
but the four stranger knights lay still. Their friends,
however, rushed to their rescue, and soon the challengers
were lost in a sea of steel.</p>
<p>Now the lady in whose honour the lists were defended
by these four brave brethren in arms sat beholding their
prowess in the keenest anxiety. Soon the knights of
Nantes were reinforced by their friends, and the strife
waxed furiously, sword to sword and lance to lance.
First one company and then the other gained the
advantage, but, urged on by rashness, the four challenging
champions charged boldly in front of their
comrades and became separated from them, with the
dire result that three of them were killed and the fourth
was so grievously wounded that he was borne from the
press in a condition hovering between life and death.
So furious were the stranger knights because of the
resistance that had been made by the four champions
that they cast their opponents&rsquo; shields outside the lists.
But the knights of Nantes won the day, and, raising
their three slain comrades and him who was wounded,
carried all four to the house of their lady-love.</p>
<p>When the sad procession reached her doors the lady
was greatly grieved and cast down. To her three dead
lovers she gave sumptuous burial in a fair abbey. As
for the fourth, she tended him with such skill that ere
long his wounds were healed and he was quite recovered.
One summer day the knight and the lady sat together
after meat, and a great sadness fell upon her because of
the knights who had been slain in her cause. Her head
sank upon her breast and she seemed lost in a reverie
of sorrow. The knight, perceiving her distress, could
not well understand what had wounded her so deeply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a great sorrow seems to be yours.
Reveal your grief to me, and perchance I can find you
comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; replied the lady, &ldquo;I grieve for your companions
who are gone. Never was lady or damsel
served by four such valiant knights, three of whom were
slain in one single day. Pardon me if I call them to
mind at this time, but it is my intention to make a
lay in order that these champions and yourself may
not be forgotten, and I will call it &lsquo;The Lay of the
Four Sorrows.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lady,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;call it not &lsquo;The Lay of
the Four Sorrows,&rsquo; but rather &lsquo;The Lay of the Dolorous
Knight.&rsquo; My three comrades are dead. They have
gone to their place; no more hope have they of life; all
their sorrows are ended and their love for you is as dead
as they. I alone am here in life, but what have I to
hope for? I find my life more bitter than they could
find the grave. I see you in your comings and goings,
I may speak with you, but I may not have your love.
For this reason I am full of sorrow and cast down, and
thus I beg that you give your lay my name and call it
&lsquo;The Lay of the Dolorous Knight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady looked earnestly upon him. &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you speak truly. The lay shall be known by
the title you wish it to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the lay was written and entitled as the knight desired
it should be. &ldquo;I heard no more,&rdquo; says Marie, &ldquo;and
nothing more I know. Perforce I must bring my story
to a close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end of this lay is quite in the medieval manner,
and fitly concludes this chapter. We are left absolutely
in the dark as to whether the knight and the lady came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
together at last. I for one do not blame Marie for this,
as with the subtle sense of the fitness of things that
belongs to all great artists she saw how much more
effective it would be to leave matters as they were
between the lovers. There are those who will blame
her for her inconclusiveness; but let them bear in mind
that just because of what they consider her failing in
this respect they will not be likely to forget her tale,
whereas had it ended with wedding-bells they would
probably have stored it away in some mental attic with
a thousand other dusty memories.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XII_THE_SAINTS_OF_BRITTANY' id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_SAINTS_OF_BRITTANY'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII: THE SAINTS OF BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">An</span> important department in Breton folk-lore is
the hagiology of the province&mdash;the legendary
lore of its saints. This, indeed, holds almost
as much of the marvellous as its folk-tales, ballads, and
historical legends, and in perusing the tales of Brittany&rsquo;s
saintly heroes we have an opportunity of observing how
the <i>motifs</i> of popular fiction and even of pagan belief
reflect upon religious romance.</p>
<p>Just as some mythology is not in itself religious, but
very often mere fiction fortuitously connected with the
names of the gods, so hagiology is not of sacerdotal but
popular origin. For the most part it describes the
origin of its heroes and accounts for their miracles and
marvellous deeds by various means, just as mythology
does. It must be remembered that the primitive saint
was in close touch with paganism, that, indeed, he had
frequently to fight the Druid and the magician with his
own weapons, and therefore we must not be surprised
if in some of these tales we find him somewhat of a
magician himself. But he is invariably on the side of
light, and the things of darkness and evil shrink from
contact with him.</p>
<h3><i>St Barbe</i></h3>
<p>Overlooking the valley of the EllÃ©, near the beautiful
and historic village of Le Faouet, is a ledge of rock,
approached by an almost inaccessible pathway. On
this ledge stands the chapel of St Barbe, one of the
strangest and most &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; of the Breton saints. She
protects those who seek her aid from sudden death,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
especially death by lightning. Of recent years popular
belief has extended her sphere of influence to cover those
who travel by automobile! She is also regarded as the
patroness of firemen, at whose annual dinner her statue,
surrounded by flowers, presides. She is extremely
popular in Brittany, and once a year, on the last
Sunday of June, pilgrims arrive at Le Faouet to celebrate
her festival. Each, as he passes the belfry which
stands beside the path, pulls the bell-rope, and the
young men make the tour of a small neighbouring
chapel, dedicated to St Michel, Lord of Heights. Then
they drink of a little fountain near at hand and purchase
amulets, which are supposed to be a preservative against
sudden death and which are known as &lsquo;Couronnes de
Ste Barbe.&rsquo; St Barbe is said to have been the daughter
of a pagan father, and to have been so beautiful that he
shut her up in a tower and permitted no one to go near
her. She succeeded, however, in communicating with
the outer world, and sent a letter to Origen of Alexandria,
entreating him to instruct her in the Christian
faith, as she had ceased to believe in the gods of her
fathers. Origen dispatched one of his monks to her,
and under his guidance she became a Christian. She
was called upon to suffer for her faith, for she was
brought before the Gallo-Roman proconsul, and, since
she refused to sacrifice to the pagan gods, was savagely
maltreated, and sentenced to be beaten as she walked
naked through the streets; but she raised her eyes to
heaven and a cloud descended and hid her from the
gaze of the impious mortals who would otherwise
have witnessed her martyrdom. Subsequently she was
spirited away to the top of a mountain, where, however,
her presence was betrayed by a shepherd. Her pagan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
father, learning of her hiding-place, quickly ascended
the height and beheaded her with his own hand.
The legends of St Barbe abound in strange details,
which are more intelligible if we regard the Saint as
being the survival of some elemental goddess connected
with fire. The vengeance of heaven descended upon
her enemies, for both her father and the shepherd who
betrayed her were destroyed, the former being struck
by lightning on his descent from the mountain, and the
latter being turned into marble.</p>
<p>The legend of the foundation of the chapel at Le
Faouet is illustrative of the strange powers of this
saint. A Lord of Toulboudou, near GuÃ©menÃ©, was
overtaken by a severe thunderstorm while hunting.
No shelter was available, and as the storm increased in
fury the huntsmen trembled for their lives, and doubtless
repeated with much fervour the old Breton charm:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Sainte Barbe et sainte Claire,</p>
<p>Preservez-moi du tonnerre,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Si le tonnerre tombe</p>
<p>Qu&rsquo;il ne tombe pas sur moi!</p>
</div></div>
<p>which may be roughly translated:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Saint Barbe the great and sainted Clair,</p>
<p>Preserve me from the lightning&rsquo;s glare.</p>
<p>When thunderbolts are flashing red</p>
<p>Let them not burst upon my head.</p>
</div></div>
<p>The Lord of Toulboudou, however, was not content
with praying to the Saint. He vowed that if by her
intercession he was preserved from death he would
raise a chapel to her honour on the narrow ledge of
rock above. No sooner had he made this vow than the
storm subsided, and safety was once more assured. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
the ancient archives of Le Faouet we read that on the
6th of July, 1489, John of Toulboudou bought of John
of Bouteville, Lord of Faouet, a piece of ground on the
flank of the Roche-Marche-Bran, twenty-five feet by
sixteen feet, on which to build a chapel to the honour of
St Barbe, and there the chapel stands to this day.</p>
<h3><i>How St Convoyon Stole the Relics</i></h3>
<p>St Convoyon, first Abbot of Redon (or Rodon) and
Bishop of Quimper, was of noble birth. He was born
near Saint-Malo and educated at Vannes under Bishop
Reginald, who ordained him as deacon and afterward
as priest. Five clerks attached themselves to him, and
the company went to dwell together in a forest near the
river Vilaine, finally establishing themselves at Redon.
The lord of that district was very favourably inclined
toward the monastery and sent his son to be educated
there, and when he himself fell sick and believed his
last hours to be nigh he caused himself to be carried
to this religious house, where his hair was shaven to
the monastic pattern. Contrary to expectation, he recovered,
and after settling his affairs at his castle he
returned to Redon, where he died at a later date. St
Convoyon had some difficulty in obtaining confirmation
of the grants given to him by this seigneur. He set
out with a disciple named Gwindeluc to seek the consent
of Louis the Pious, taking with him a quantity of wax
from his bees at Redon, intending to present it to
the King, but he was refused admission to the royal
presence. But NomenoÃ«, Governor of Brittany, visited
Redon, and encouraged the Saint to endeavour once
more to obtain the King&rsquo;s sanction, and this time Louis
confirmed the grants.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>So the monastery of Redon was built and its church
erected, but, as the chroniclers tell us, &ldquo;there was no
saintly corpse under its altar to act as palladium to the
monastery and work miracles to attract pilgrims.&rdquo;
Convoyon therefore set out for Angers, accompanied
by two of his monks, and found lodging there with a
pious man named Hildwall. The latter inquired as to
the object of their visit to Angers, and with considerable
hesitation, and only after extracting a promise of secrecy,
Convoyon confessed that they had come on a body-snatching
expedition. He asked his friend&rsquo;s advice as
to what relics they should endeavour to secure. Hildwall
told him that interred in the cathedral were the
bones of St Apothemius, a bishop, of whom nothing
was known save that he was a saint. His bones lay in
a stone coffin which had a heavy lid. Hildwall added
that several monks had attempted to steal the relics,
but in vain. Convoyon and his monks bided their time
for three days, and then on a dark night, armed with
crowbars, they set out on their gruesome mission.</p>
<p>They reached the cathedral, entered, and, after singing
praises and hymns, raised the coffin lid. Securing the
bones, they made off with them as quickly as possible,
and in due course reached Redon with them in safety.
The reception of the relics was celebrated by the monks
with great pomp and ceremony. Miracles were at once
performed, and the popularity of St Apothemius was
firmly established.</p>

CONVOYON AND HIS MONKS CARRY OFF THE RELICS OF ST APOTHEMIUS<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>When the Bishop of Vannes died, in 837, the see was
filled by Susannus, who obtained it by bribery. Convoyon,
grieved and indignant at the prevalence of
corruption in the Church, urged NomenoÃ« to summon
a council of bishops and abbots and endeavour to put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
a stop to these deplorable practices. At this council
the canons against simony were read; but the bishops
retorted that they did not sell Holy Orders, and expected
no fees&mdash;though they took presents! Susannus
was, naturally enough, most emphatic about this. At
length it was decided that a deputation should be sent
to Rome to obtain an authoritative statement on the
point, and that it should consist of Susannus of Vannes,
FÃ©lix of Quimper, and Convoyon, who was to carry
&ldquo;gold crowns inlaid with jewels&rdquo; as a gift from
NomenoÃ« to the Pope. The decision given by Pope
Leo on the matter is far from clear. The Nantes
chronicle asserts that Leo made Convoyon a duke, and
gave him permission to wear a gold coronet. He also
presented him with a valuable gift&mdash;the bones of
St Marcellinus, Bishop of Rome and martyr, which
Convoyon took back with him to Redon and deposited
in his church there.</p>
<p>On a later day NomenoÃ« raised the standard of revolt
against Charles the Bald of France&mdash;a circumstance
alluded to in our historical sketch. He ravaged Poitou
with sword and flame, but respected the abbey of Saint-Florent,
though, to insult Charles, he forced the monks
to place a statue of himself on their tower, with the face
turned defiantly toward France. During NomenoÃ«&rsquo;s
absence the monks sent news of his action to the
hairless monarch, who tore down the statue and erected
a white stone figure &ldquo;of ludicrous appearance,&rdquo; its
mocking face turned toward Brittany. In revenge
NomenoÃ« burned Saint-Florent to the ground and carried
off the spoils to enrich the abbey of Redon. The
success of the Breton chief forced Charles to come to
terms. NomenoÃ« and his son, it was agreed, should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
assume the insignia of royalty and hold Rennes, Nantes,
and all Brittany.</p>
<p>Convoyon, as we have seen, benefited by the spoils won
by the Breton champion. Later, as his abbey at
Redon was situated by a tidal river, and was thus
exposed to the ravages of the Normans, he and his
monks moved farther inland to PlÃ©lan. There he died
and was buried, about <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 868, but his body was afterward
removed to Redon, where he had lived and
laboured so long. His relics were dispersed during the
troublous times of the Revolution.</p>
<h3><i>Tivisiau, the Shepherd Saint</i></h3>
<p>St Tivisiau, or, more correctly, Turiau, has a large
parish, as, although he was Bishop of Dol, we find him
venerated as patron saint as far west as Landivisiau.
He belongs to the earlier half of the seventh century,
and, unlike most other Armorican ascetics, was of Breton
origin, his father, Lelian, and his mother, Mageen, being
graziers on the borders of the romantic and beautiful
forest of Broceliande. The young Tivisiau was set to
watch the sheep, and as he did so he steeped his soul in
the beauty of the wonderful forest land about him, and
his thoughts formed themselves into lays, which he
sang as he tended his flock, for, like that other shepherd
of old, King David, his exquisite voice could clothe his
beautiful thoughts. The monastery of Balon stood
near the lad&rsquo;s home, and often he would leave his sheep
in the wilderness and steal away to listen to the monks
chanting. Sometimes he joined in the service, and one
day the Bishop of Dol, paying a visit to this outlying
portion of his diocese, heard the sweet, clear notes of
the boy&rsquo;s voice soaring above the lower tones of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
monks. Enthralled by its beauty, the Bishop made
inquiries as to who the singer was, and Tivisiau being
brought forward, the prelate asked him to sing to him.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_28' id='linki_28'></a>

<img src='images/gs28.jpg' alt='' title='' width='420' height='600' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
ST TIVISIAU, THE SHEPHERD SAINT<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Again and again did he sing, till at last the Bishop,
who had lingered as long as he might in the little out-of-the-world
monastery to listen to the young songster,
was obliged to take his departure. The boy&rsquo;s personality
had, however, so won his affection that he arranged
with the monks of Balon that he should take him to
Dol, and so it came about that Tivisiau was educated
at that ancient religious centre, where his voice was
carefully trained. The Bishop made him his suffragan,
and, later Abbot of Dol, and when at length he came to
relinquish the burden of his office he named Tivisiau as
his successor.</p>
<p>The story provides a noteworthy example of the power
exercised in early times by a beautiful voice. But this
love of music and the susceptibility to the emotion it
calls forth are not peculiar to any century of Celtdom.
Love of music, and the temperament that can hear the
voice of the world&rsquo;s beauty, in music, in poetry, in the
wild sea that breaks on desolate shores, or in the hushed
wonder of hills and valleys, is as much a part of the
Celt as are the thews and the sinews that have helped
to carry him through the hard days of toil and poverty
that have been the lot of so many of his race in their
struggle for existence&mdash;whether in the far-off Outer
Isles of the mist-wreathed and mystic west coast of
Scotland, or among the Welsh mountains, or in picturesque
Brittany, or in the distressful, beautiful, sorrow-haunted
Green Isle.</p>
<p>At Landivisiau one finds much exquisite carving in
the south porch, which is all that remains of the early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
building to show how beautiful must have been the
church to which it belonged. There is also a very
ancient and picturesque fountain, known to tradition as
that of St Tivisiau.</p>
<h3><i>St Nennocha</i></h3>
<p>The legend of Nennocha is held to be pure fable, but
is interesting nevertheless. It tells how a king in Wales,
called Breochan, had fourteen sons, who all deserted
him to preach the Gospel. Breochan then made a vow
that if God would grant him another child he would
give to the Church a tithe of all his gold and his lands,
and later on his wife, Moneduc, bore him a daughter,
whom they baptized Nennocha. Nennocha was sent
away to a foster father and mother, returning home at
the age of fourteen. A prince of Ireland sought her
hand in marriage, but St Germain, who was then at her
father&rsquo;s palace, persuaded her to embrace the religious
life, and the disappointed King sadly gave his consent.
A great multitude assembled to accompany the maiden
in her renunciation of the world, &ldquo;numbering in its
midst four bishops and many priests and virgins.&rdquo; We
are told how they all took ship together and sailed to
Brittany. The Breton king gave the princess land at
Ploermel, and there she founded a great monastery,
where she lived till death claimed her.</p>
<h3><i>St Enora</i></h3>
<p>Several old Breton songs tell us the story of St Enora
(or Honora), the wife of Efflam (already alluded to in
the chapter on Arthurian legend), but these accounts
vary very considerably in their details. One account
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
giving us &ldquo;stern facts&rdquo; relates how St Efflam was
betrothed for political reasons to Enora, a Saxon princess,
and speaks of how impossible it was to expect
that such a union could prove anything but disastrous
when it was not a love match. So, whether partly to
escape from a married life which jarred his susceptibilities,
or entirely on account of his religious asceticism,
Efflam left his wife and crossed to Brittany to lead the
life of a religious hermit. One of the Breton songs gives
the beginning of the story in a much more picturesque
way. It relates how Enora, &ldquo;beautiful as an angel,&rdquo;
had many suitors, but would give her hand to none save
the Prince Efflam, &ldquo;son of a stranger King.&rdquo; But
Efflam, torn by the desire to lead the religious life, far
away from the world, rose &ldquo;in the midst of the night,
his wedding night,&rdquo; and crept softly away, no one seeing
him save his faithful dog, which he loved. So he came
to the seashore and crossed to Brittany. The story of
his landing and his meeting with Arthur has already
been told, and we have seen how his fate was once more,
by divine agency, linked with that of Enora. The song
tells us how the angels carried the princess over the sea
and set her on the door-sill of her husband&rsquo;s cell. Presently
she awoke, and, finding herself there, she knocked
three times and cried out to her husband that she was
&ldquo;his sweetheart, his wife,&rdquo; whom God had sent. St
Efflam, knowing her voice, came out, and &ldquo;with many
godly words he took her hand in his.&rdquo; One account
says that he sent her to the south of Brittany to found a
convent for nuns, as he wished to devote his life entirely
to the service of God and the contemplation of nature.
All versions agree on the point that he built a hut for
her beside his own, and one story relates how he made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
her wear a veil over her face and only spoke to her
through the door! But one Breton song with more
of the matter of poetry in it than the rest tells how
the little hut he built for her was shaded by green bushes
and sheltered by a rock, and that there they lived, side
by side, for a long and happy time, while the fame of
the miracles they wrought spread through the land.
Then one night some sailors on the sea &ldquo;saw the sky
open and heard a burst of heavenly music,&rdquo; and next
day when a poor woman took her sick child to Enora
to beg for her aid she could get no response, and looking
in she beheld the royal lady lying dead. The humble
place was alight with her radiance, and near her a little
boy in white was kneeling. The woman then ran to
tell St Efflam of her discovery, only to find that he too
was lying dead in his cell.</p>
<h3><i>Corseul the Accursed</i></h3>
<p>The town of Corseul has sunk into insignificance, and
its failure to achieve prosperity is said to be due to its
covert hostility to St Malo&mdash;or, as he is more correctly
called, Machutes. Coming to Brittany on missionary
enterprise, the Saint found that Christianity had not
penetrated to the district of Corseul, where the old
pagan worship still obtained. He therefore decided
that his work must lie chiefly among the Curiosolites
of that land, and determined that his first celebration
of Easter Mass there should take place in the very
centre of the pagan worship, the temple of Haute-BÃ©cherel.
The people of the district received him
coldly, but without open hostility, and he and his monks
prepared for the Christian festival in the pagan shrine,
to find to their dismay that they had omitted to bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
either chalice or wine for the Eucharist. Several of
the monks were sent into the town to buy these, but in
all Corseul they could find no one willing to sell either
cup or wine, because of the hostility of the idolatrous
folk of the place. At last the Saint performed a miracle
to provide these necessaries, but he never forgave the
insult to his religion, and while he founded monasteries
broadcast over his diocese he avoided Corseul, and as
Christianity became more and more universal the pagan
town gradually paid the penalty of its enmity to the
cause of Christ.</p>
<h3><i>St Keenan</i></h3>
<p>St Keenan (sixth century) was surnamed Colodoc, or
&ldquo;He who loves to lose himself,&rdquo; a beautiful epitome of
his character. As in so many instances in the chronicles
of Breton hagiology, confusion regarding St Keenan
has arisen among a multiplicity of chronicles. He
seems to have been a native of Connaught, whence he
crossed into Wales and became a disciple of Gildas.</p>
<p>He was told to &ldquo;go forward&rdquo; carrying a little bell, until
he reached a place called Ros-ynys, where the bell
would ring of itself, and there he would find rest. He
asked Gildas to provide him with a bell, but the abbot
could only supply him with a small piece of metal.
Keenan, however, blessed this, and it grew until it
was large enough for a good bell to be cast from it.
Thus equipped, the Saint set out, and journeyed until
he reached an arm of the sea, where he sat down on
the grass to rest. While lying at his ease he heard
a herdsman call to his fellow: &ldquo;Brother, have you seen
my cows anywhere?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I
saw them at Ros-ynys.&rdquo; Rejoicing greatly at finding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
himself in the vicinity of the place he sought, Keenan
descended to the shore, which has since been called
by his name. Greatly athirst, he struck a rock with
his staff, and water gushed forth in answer to the stroke.
Taking ship, he crossed the firth and entered a little
wood. All at once, to his extreme joy, the bell he
carried commenced to tinkle, and he knew he had
reached the end of his journey&mdash;the valley of Ros-ynys,
afterward St David&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Later, deciding to cross to Brittany with his disciples,
Keenan dispatched some of his company to beg for
corn for their journey from a merchant at Landegu.
They met with a gruff refusal, but the merchant
mockingly informed them they could have the corn
if they carried off the whole of his barge-load. When
the Saint embarked the barge broke its moorings and
floated after him all the way! He landed at ClÃ©der,
where he built a monastery, which he enriched with
a copy of the Gospels transcribed by his own hand.</p>
<p>The fatal contest between King Arthur and Modred,
his nephew, caused Keenan to return to Britain, and
he is said to have been present at the battle of Camelot
and to have comforted Guinevere after the death of
her royal husband, exhorting her to enter a convent.
He afterward returned to ClÃ©der, where he died. The
monastery fell into ruin, and the place of his burial
was forgotten, till one night an angel appeared in a
vision to one of the inhabitants of ClÃ©der and bade
him exhume the bones of the Saint, which he would
find at a certain spot. This the man did, and the relics
were recovered. A fragment of them is preserved in
the cathedral of Saint-Brieuc. St Keenan is popularly
known in Brittany as St KÃ©, or St Quay.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<h3><i>St Nicholas</i></h3>
<p>One very interesting and curious saint is St Nicholas,
whose cult cannot be traced to any Christian source,
and who is most probably the survival of some pagan
divinity. He is specially the saint of seafaring men,
and is believed to bring them good luck, asking nothing
in return save that they shall visit his shrine whenever
they happen to pass. This is a somewhat dilapidated
chapel at LandÃ©vennec, of which the seamen seem to
show their appreciation, if one may judge from the
fact that the little path leading up to it is exceedingly
well worn.</p>
<h3><i>St Bieuzy</i></h3>
<p>St Bieuzy was a friend and disciple of St Gildas. Flying
from England at the coming of the Saxons, they
crossed to Brittany and settled there, one of their
favourite retreats being the exquisite La Roche-sur-Blavet,
where they took up their abode in the shadow
of the great rock and built a rough wooden shelter.
The chapel there shows the &lsquo;bell&rsquo; of St Gildas, and
by the river is a great boulder hollowed like a chair,
where Bieuzy was wont to sit and fish. St Bieuzy, however,
possessed thaumaturgical resources of his own,
having the gift of curing hydrophobia, and the hermitage
of La Roche-sur-Blavet became so thronged by
those seeking his aid that only by making a private
way to the top of the great rock could he obtain respite
to say his prayers. This gift of his was the cause of
his tragic death. One day as he was celebrating Mass
the servant of a pagan chief ran into the chapel, crying
out that his master&rsquo;s dogs had gone mad, and demanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
that Bieuzy should come immediately and cure them.
Bieuzy was unwilling to interrupt the sacred service
and displeased at the irreverence of the demand, and
the servant returned to his master, who rushed into
the chapel and in his savage frenzy struck the Saint
such a blow with his sword that he cleft his head in
twain. The heroic Saint completed the celebration of
Mass&mdash;the sword still in the wound&mdash;and then, followed
by the whole congregation, he walked to the monastery
of Rhuys, where he received the blessing of his beloved
St Gildas, and fell dead at his feet. He was buried
in the church, and a fountain at Rhuys was dedicated
to him. It is satisfactory to note that the entire establishment
of the murderer of the Saint is said to have
perished of hydrophobia!</p>
<h3><i>St Leonorius</i></h3>
<p>St Leonorius, or LÃ©onore (sixth century), was a disciple
of St Iltud, of Wales, and was ordained by St Dubricus;
he crossed to Brittany in early life. The legend that
most closely attaches to his name is one of the most
beautiful of all the Breton beliefs, and is full of the
poetry and romance that exist for the Celt in all the
living things around him. The Saint and his monks
had worked hard to till their ground&mdash;for the labours
of holy men included many duties in addition to religious
ministrations&mdash;but when they came to sow the seed they
found that they had omitted to provide themselves with
wheat! All their labour seemed in vain, and they were
greatly distressed as to what they would do for food if
they had no harvest to look forward to, when suddenly
they saw, perched on a little wayside cross, a tiny robin
redbreast holding in its beak an ear of wheat! The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
monks joyfully took the grain, and, sowing it, reaped
an abundant harvest! Accounts vary somewhat in the
details of this story. Some say that the bird led the
monks to a store of grain, and others question the fact
that the bird was a robin, but the popular idea is that
the robin proffered the grain, and so universal and so
strong is this belief that &ldquo;Robin Redbreast&rsquo;s corn&rdquo;
is a byword in Brittany for &ldquo;small beginnings that
prosper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Saint is said to have possessed the most marvellous
attainments. We are told that he learnt the alphabet
in one day, the &ldquo;art of spelling&rdquo; the following day, and
calligraphy the next! He is also said to have been a
bishop at the age of fifteen. Tradition avers that he
ploughed the land with stags, and that an altar was
brought to him from the depth of the sea by two wild
pigeons to serve for his ministrations. The circumstance
that animals or birds were employed&mdash;predominantly
the latter&mdash;as the divine means of rendering aid to the
Saint is common to many of these legends. We thus
have saintly romance linked with the &lsquo;friendly animals&rsquo;
formula of folk-lore.</p>
<h3><i>St Patern</i></h3>
<p>Many quaint and pretty stories are told of the childhood
and youth of St Patern, the patron saint of Vannes.
His intense religious fervour was probably inherited
from his father, Petranus, who, we are told, left his wife
and infant son and crossed to Ireland to embrace the
life religious. One day as his mother sat by the open
window making a dress for her baby she was called
away, and left the little garment lying on the sill. A
bird flew past, and, attracted by the soft woollen stuff,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
carried it off to line its nest. A year later when the
nest was destroyed the dress was discovered as fresh
and clean as when it was stolen&mdash;a piece of symbolism
foretelling the purity and holiness of the future
saint.</p>
<p>As soon as the child could speak his mother sent him to
school. She hoped great things from the quiet, earnest
boy, in whom she had observed signs of fervent piety.
One day he came home and asked his mother where his
father was. &ldquo;All the other boys have fathers,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;where is mine?&rdquo; His mother sadly told him that his
father, wishing to serve God more perfectly than it was
possible for him to do at home, had gone to Ireland to
become a monk. &ldquo;Thither shall I go too, when I&rsquo;m a
man,&rdquo; said Patern, and he made a resolve that when he
grew up he would also enter a monastery. Accordingly,
having finished his studies in the monastery of Rhuys,
he set out for Britain, where he founded two religious
houses, and then crossed to Ireland, where he met his
father. Eventually he returned to Vannes, as one of
the nine bishops of Brittany, but he did not agree with
his brethren regarding certain ecclesiastical laws, and
at last, not wishing to &ldquo;lose his patience,&rdquo; he abandoned
his diocese and went to France, where he ended his days
as a simple monk.</p>
<p>There is an interesting legend to account for the foundation
of the church of St Patern at Vannes. We are
told how for three years after Patern left Vannes the
people were afflicted by a dreadful famine. No rain
fell, and the distress was great. At length it was
remembered that Patern had departed without giving
the people his blessing, and at once &ldquo;a pilgrimage set
forth to bring back his sacred body, that it might rest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
in his own episcopal town.&rdquo; But the body of the blessed
Patern &ldquo;refused to be removed,&rdquo; until one of the
pilgrims, who had before denied the bishop a certain
piece of ground, promised to gift it to his memory and
to build a church on it to the Saint&rsquo;s honour, whereupon
the body became light enough to be lifted from the
grave and conveyed to Vannes. No sooner had the
sacred corpse entered Vannes than rain fell in torrents.
Hagiology abounds in instances of this description, which
in many respects bring it into line with mythology.</p>
<h3><i>St Samson</i></h3>
<p>We have already related the story of Samson&rsquo;s birth.
Another legend regarding him tells how one day when
the youths attached to the monastery where he dwelt
were out winnowing corn one of the monks was bitten
by an adder and fainted with fright. Samson ran to
St Iltud to tell the news, with tears in his eyes, and
begged to be allowed to attempt the cure of the monk.
Iltud gave him permission, and Samson, full of faith and
enthusiasm, rubbed the bite with oil, and by degrees
the monk recovered. After this Samson&rsquo;s fame grew
apace. Indeed, we are told that the monks grew jealous
of him and attempted to poison him. He was ordained
a bishop at York, and lived a most austere life, though
his humanity was very apparent in his love for animals.</p>
<p>He was made abbot of a monastery, and endeavoured
to instil temperance into the monks, but at length gave
up the attempt in despair and settled in a cave at the
mouth of the Severn. Then one night &ldquo;a tall man&rdquo;
appeared to him in a vision, and bade him go to
Armorica, saying to him&mdash;so the legend goes: &ldquo;Thou
goest by the sea, and where thou wilt disembark thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
shalt find a well. Over this thou wilt build a church,
and around it will group the houses forming the city of
which thou wilt be a bishop.&rdquo; All of which came to
pass, and for ages the town has been known as the
episcopal city of Dol. Accompanied by forty monks,
Samson crossed the Channel and landed in the Bay of
Saint-Brieuc. One version of the story tells us that the
Saint and numerous other monks fled from Britain to
escape the Saxon tyranny, and that Samson and six
of his suffragans who crossed the sea with him were
known as the &lsquo;Seven Saints of Brittany.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><i>Brittany&rsquo;s Lawyer Saint</i></h3>
<p>Few prosperous and wealthy countries produce saints
in any great number, and in proof of the converse of
this we find much hagiology in Brittany and Ireland.
Let lawyers take note that while many saints spring
from among the <i>bourgeoisie</i> they include few legal men.
An outstanding exception to this rule is St Yves (or
Yvo), probably the best known, and almost certainly
the most beloved, saint in Brittany. St Yves is the only
regularly canonized Breton saint. He was born at
Kermartin, near TrÃ©guier, in 1253, his father being lord
of that place. The house where he first saw the light
was pulled down in 1834, but the bed in which he
was born is still preserved and shown. His name is
borne by the majority of the inhabitants of the districts
of TrÃ©guier and Saint-Brieuc, and one authority tells us
how &ldquo;in the Breton tongue his praises are sung as
follows:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>N&rsquo;hen eus ket en Breiz, n&rsquo;hen eus ket unan,</p>
<p>N&rsquo;hen eus ket uer Zant evel Sant Erwan.</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>This, in French, runs:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Il n&rsquo;y a pas en Bretagne, il n&rsquo;y en a pas un,</p>
<p>Il n&rsquo;y a pas un saint comme saint Yves.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>He began his legal education when he was fourteen,
and studied law in the schools of Paris, becoming an
ecclesiastical judge, and later (1285) an ordained priest
and incumbent of Tredrig. Subsequently he was made
incumbent of Lohanec, which post he held till his death.
As a judge he possessed a quality rare in those days&mdash;he
was inaccessible to bribery! That this was
appreciated we find in the following <i>bon mot</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Saint Yves Ã©tait Breton,</p>
<p>Avocat et pas larron:</p>
<p>Chose rare, se dit-on.</p>
</div></div>
<p>He invariably endeavoured to induce disputants to settle
their quarrels &lsquo;out of court&rsquo; if possible, and applied his
talents to defending the cause of the poor and oppressed,
without fee. He was known as &lsquo;the poor man&rsquo;s
advocate,&rsquo; and to-day in the department of the CÃ´tes-du-Nord,
when a debtor repudiates his debt, the creditor
will pay for a Mass to St Yves, in the hope that he will
cause the defaulter to die within the year! St Yves de
VÃ©ritÃ© is the special patron of lawyers, and is represented
in the <i>mortier</i>, or lawyer&rsquo;s cap, and robe.</p>
<p>St Yves spent most of his income in charity, turning his
house into an orphanage, and many are the stories told
of his humanity and generosity. The depth of his
sympathy, and its practical result, are shown in an
incident told us of how one morning he found a poor,
half-naked man lying on his doorstep shivering with
cold, having spent the night there. Yves gave up his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
bed to the beggar the next night, and himself slept on
the doorstep, desiring to learn by personal experience
the sufferings of the poor. On another occasion, while
being fitted with a new coat, he caught sight of a
miserable man on the pavement outside who was clad
in rags and tatters that showed his skin through many
rents. Yves tore off the new coat and, rushing out,
gave it to the beggar, saying to the astonished and
horrified tailor: &ldquo;There is plenty of wear still in my
old coats. I will content myself with them.&rdquo; His pity
and generosity led him to still further kindness when he
was visiting a hospital and saw how ill-clad some of the
patients were, for he actually gave them the clothes he
was wearing at the time, wrapping himself in a coverlet
till he had other garments sent to him from home. He
was wont to walk beside the ploughmen in the fields and
teach them prayers. He would sit on the moors beside
the shepherd-boys and instruct them in the use of the
rosary; and often he would stop little children in the street,
and gain their interest and affection by his gentleness.</p>

ST YVES INSTRUCTING SHEPHERD-BOYS IN THE USE OF THE ROSARY<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>His shrewd legal mind was of service to the poor in
other ways than in the giving of advice. A story is
told of how two rogues brought a heavy chest to a
widow, declaring it to contain twelve hundred pieces
of gold and asking her to take charge of it. Some
weeks later one of them returned, claimed the box, and
removed it. A few days later the second of the men
arrived and asked for the box, and when the poor
woman could not produce it he took her to court and
sued her for the gold it had contained. Yves, on
hearing that the case was going against the woman,
offered to defend her, and pleaded that his client was
ready to restore the gold, but only to both the men who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
had committed it to her charge, and that therefore both
must appear to claim it. This was a blow to the rogues,
who attempted to escape, and, failing to do so, at length
confessed that they had plotted to extort money from
the widow, the chest containing nothing but pieces of
old iron.</p>
<p>Yves was so eloquent and earnest a preacher that
he was continually receiving requests to attend other
churches, which he never refused. On the Good Friday
before his death he preached in seven different parishes.
He died at the age of fifty, and was buried at TrÃ©guier.
Duke John V, who founded the Chapelle du Duc, had a
special regard for Yves, and erected a magnificent tomb
to his memory, which was for three centuries the object
of veneration in Brittany.</p>
<p>During the French Revolution the reliquary of St Yves
was destroyed, but his bones were preserved and have
been re-enshrined at TrÃ©guier. His last will and testament&mdash;leaving
all his goods to the poor&mdash;is preserved,
together with his breviary, in the sacristy of the church
at Minihy.</p>
<p>The Saint is generally represented with a cat as his
symbol&mdash;typifying the lawyer&rsquo;s watchful character&mdash;but
this hardly seems a fitting emblem for such a beautiful
character as St Yves.</p>
<h3><i>St Budoc of Dol</i></h3>
<p>The legend of St Budoc of Dol presents several peculiar
features. It was first recited by professional minstrels,
then &ldquo;passed into the sanctuary, and was read in prose
in cathedral and church choirs as a narrative of facts,&rdquo;
although it seems curious that it could have been held
to be other than fiction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>A Count of Goelc, in Brittany, sought in marriage
AzÃ©nor, &ldquo;tall as a palm, bright as a star,&rdquo; but they had
not been wedded a year when AzÃ©nor&rsquo;s father married
again, and his new wife, jealous of her stepdaughter,
hated her and determined to ruin her. Accordingly she
set to work to implant suspicion as to AzÃ©nor&rsquo;s purity
in the minds of her father and husband, and the Count
shut his wife up in a tower and forbade her to speak to
anyone. Here all the poor Countess could do was to
pray to her patron saint, the Holy Bridget of Ireland.</p>
<p>Her stepmother, however, was not content with the
evil she had already wrought, and would not rest until
she had brought about AzÃ©nor&rsquo;s death. She continued
her calumnies, and at length the Count assembled all his
barons and his court to judge his wife. The unfortunate
and innocent Countess was brought into the hall for
trial, and, seated on a little stool in the midst of the
floor, the charges were read to her and she was called
upon to give her reply. With tears she protested her
innocence, but in spite of the fact that no proof could
be brought against her she was sent in disgrace to her
father in Brest. He in turn sat in judgment upon her,
and condemned her to death, the sentence being that
she should be placed in a barrel and cast into the sea,
&ldquo;to be carried where the winds and tides listed.&rdquo; We
are told that the barrel floated five months, &ldquo;tossing up
and down&rdquo;&mdash;during which time AzÃ©nor was supplied
with food by an angel, who passed it to her through the
bung-hole.</p>
<p>During these five months, the legend continues, the
poor Countess became a mother, the angel and St
Bridget watching over her. As soon as the child was
born his mother made the sign of the Cross upon him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
made him kiss a crucifix, and patiently waited the
coming of an opportunity to have him baptized. The
child began to speak while in the cask. At last the
barrel rolled ashore at Youghal Harbour, in the county
of Cork. An Irish peasant, thinking he had found a
barrel of wine, was proceeding to tap it with a gimlet
when he heard a voice from within say: &ldquo;Do not
injure the cask.&rdquo; Greatly astonished, the man demanded
who was inside, and the voice replied: &ldquo;I am a child
desiring baptism. Go at once to the abbot of the
monastery to which this land belongs, and bid him come
and baptize me.&rdquo; The Irishman ran to the abbot with
the message, but he not unnaturally declined to believe
the story, till, with a true Hibernian touch, the peasant
asked him if it were likely that he would have told &lsquo;his
reverence&rsquo; anything about his find had there been
&ldquo;anything better than a baby&rdquo; in the barrel! Accordingly
the abbot hastened to the shore, opened the cask,
and freed the long-suffering Countess of Goelc and her
son, the latter of whom he christened by the name of
Budoc, and took under his care.</p>
<p>Meantime, the &ldquo;wicked stepmother,&rdquo; falling ill and
being at the point of death, became frightened when she
thought of her sin against AzÃ©nor, and confessed the
lies by which she had wrought the ruin of the Countess.
The Count, overcome by remorse and grief, set out in
quest of his wife. Good luck led him to Ireland,
where he disembarked at Youghal and found his lost
ones. With great rejoicing he had a stately ship
made ready, and prepared to set out for Brittany with
AzÃ©nor and Budoc, but died before he could embark.
AzÃ©nor remained in Ireland and devoted herself to good
works and to the training of her son, who from an early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
age resolved to embrace the religious life, and was in
due course made a monk by the Abbot of Youghal.
His mother died, and on the death of the Abbot of
Youghal he was elected to rule the monastery. Later,
upon the death of the King of Ireland, the natives
raised Budoc to the temporal and spiritual thrones,
making him King of Ireland and Bishop of Armagh.</p>
<p>After two years he wished to retire from these honours,
but the people were &ldquo;wild with despair&rdquo; at the tidings,
and surrounded the palace lest he should escape. One
night, while praying in his metropolitan church, an angel
appeared to him, bidding him betake himself to Brittany.
Going down to the seashore, it was indicated to him
that he must make the voyage in a stone trough. On
entering this it began to move, and he was borne across
to Brittany, landing at Porspoder, in the diocese of
LÃ©on. The people of that district drew the stone coffer
out of the water, and built a hermitage and a chapel for
the Saint&rsquo;s convenience. Budoc dwelt for one year at
Porspoder, but, &ldquo;disliking the roar of the waves,&rdquo; he
had his stone trough mounted on a cart, and yoking two
oxen to it he set forth, resolved to follow them wherever
they might go and establish himself at whatever place
they might halt. The cart broke down at Plourin, and
there Budoc settled for a short time; but trouble with
disorderly nobles forced him to depart, and this time
he went to Dol, where he was well received by St
Malglorious, then its bishop, who soon after resigned his
see to Budoc. The Saint ruled at Dol for twenty years,
and died early in the seventh century.</p>
<p>Another Celtic myth of the same type is to be found on
the shores of the Firth of Forth. The story in question
deals with the birth of St Mungo, or St Kentigern, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
patron saint of Glasgow. His mother was Thenaw,
the Christian daughter of the pagan King Lot of
Lothian, brother-in-law of King Arthur, from his
marriage with Arthur&rsquo;s sister Margawse. Thus the
famous Gawaine would be Thenaw&rsquo;s brother. Thenaw
met Ewen, the son of <a name='TC_6'></a><ins title="Was 'Eufeurien'">Eufuerien</ins>, King of Cumbria, and
fell deeply in love with him, but her father discovered
her disgrace and ordered her to be cast headlong from
the summit of Traprain Law, once known as Dunpender,
a mountain in East Lothian. A kindly fate watched
over the princess, however, and she fell so softly from
the eminence that she was uninjured. Such Christian
subjects as Lot possessed begged her life. But if her
father might have relented his Druids were inexorable.
They branded her as a sorceress, and she was doomed
to death by drowning. She was accordingly rowed out
from Aberlady Bay to the vicinity of the Isle of May,
where, seated in a skin boat, she was left to the mercy
of the waves. In this terrible situation she cast herself
upon the grace of Heaven, and her frail craft was wafted
up the Forth, where it drifted ashore near Culross. At
this spot Kentigern was born, and the mother and child
were shortly afterward discovered by some shepherds,
who placed them under the care of St Serf, Abbot
of Culross. To these events the date <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 516 is
assigned.</p>
<h3><i>&lsquo;Fatal Children&rsquo; Legends</i></h3>
<p>This legend is, of course, closely allied with those which
recount the fate and adventures of the &lsquo;fatal children.&rsquo;
Like &OElig;dipus, Romulus, Perseus, and others, Budoc
and Kentigern are obviously &lsquo;fatal children,&rsquo; as is
evidenced by the circumstances of their birth. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
are not told that King Lot or AzÃ©nor&rsquo;s father had
been warned that if their daughters had a son they
would be slain by that child, but it is probably only
the saintly nature of the subject of the stories which
caused this circumstance to be omitted. DanaÃ«, the
mother of Perseus, we remember, was, when disgraced,
shut up in a chest with her child, and committed to the
waves, which carried her to the island of Seriphos,
where she was duly rescued. Romulus and his brother
Remus were thrown into the Tiber, and escaped a
similar fate. The Princess Desonelle and her twin
sons, in the old English metrical romance of <i>Sir
Torrent of Portugal</i>, are also cast into the sea, but
succeed in making the shore of a far country. All
these children grow up endowed with marvellous beauty
and strength, but their doom is upon them, and after
numerous adventures they slay their fathers or some
other unfortunate relative. But the most characteristic
part of what seems an almost universal legend
is that these children are born in the most obscure
circumstances, afterward rising to a height of splendour
which makes up for all they previously suffered. It is
not necessary to explain nowadays that this is characteristic
of nearly all sun-myths. The sun is born in
obscurity, and rises to a height of splendour at midday.</p>
<p>Thus in the majority of these legends we find the sun
personified. It is not sufficient to object that such an
elucidation smacks too much of the tactics of Max
MÃ¼ller to be accepted by modern students of folk-lore.
The student of comparative myth who does not make
use of the best in all systems of mythological elucidation
is undone, for no one system will serve for all examples.</p>
<p>To those who may object, &ldquo;Oh, but Kentigern was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
<i>real</i> person,&rdquo; I reply that I know many myths concerning
&lsquo;real&rsquo; people. For the matter of that, we assist in the
manufacture of these every day of our lives, and it is
quite a fallacy that legends cannot spring up concerning
veritable historical personages, and even around living,
breathing folk. And for the rest of it mythology and
hagiology are hopelessly intermingled in their <i>motifs</i>.</p>
<h3><i>Miraculous Crossings</i></h3>
<p>Another Celtic saint besides Budoc possessed a stone
boat. He is St Baldred, who, like Kentigern, hails
from the Firth of Forth, and dwelt on the Bass Rock.
He is said to have chosen this drear abode as a refuge
from the eternal wars between the Picts and the Scots
toward the close of the seventh century. From this
point of vantage, and probably during seasons of truce,
he rowed to the mainland to minister to the spiritual
wants of the rude natives of Lothian. Inveresk seems
to have been the eastern border of his &lsquo;parish.&rsquo; Tradition
says that he was the second Bishop of Glasgow,
and thus the successor of Kentigern, but the lack of
all reliable data concerning the western see subsequent
to the death of Glasgow&rsquo;s patron saint makes it impossible
to say whether this statement is authentic or
otherwise. Many miracles are attributed to Baldred,
not the least striking of which is that concerning a rock
to the east of Tantallon Castle, known as &lsquo;St Baldred&rsquo;s
Boat.&rsquo; At one time this rock was situated between the
Bass and the adjacent mainland, and was a fruitful
source of shipwreck. Baldred, pitying the mariners
who had to navigate the Firth, and risk this danger,
rowed out to the rock and mounted upon it; whereupon,
at his simple nod, it was lifted up, and, like a ship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
driven by the wind, was wafted to the nearest shore,
where it thenceforth remained. This rock is sometimes
called &lsquo;St Baldred&rsquo;s Coble,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cock-boat.&rsquo; This species
of miracle is more commonly discovered in the annals of
hagiology than in those of pure myth, although in legend
we occasionally find the landscape altered by order of
supernatural or semi-supernatural beings.</p>
<p>One rather striking instance of miraculous crossing is
that of St Noyala, who is said to have crossed to
Brittany on the leaf of a tree, accompanied by her
nurse. She was beheaded at Beignon, but walked to
Pontivy carrying her head in her hands. A chapel
at Pontivy is dedicated to her, and was remarkable in
the eighteenth century for several interesting paintings
on a gold ground depicting this legend.</p>
<p>We find this incident of miraculous crossing occurring
in the stories of many of the Breton saints. A noteworthy
instance is that of St Tugdual, who, with his
followers, crossed in a ship which vanished when they
disembarked. Still another example is found in the
case of St Vougas, or Vie, who is specially venerated
in TrÃ©guennec. He is thought to have been an Irish
bishop, and is believed to have mounted a stone and
sailed across to Brittany upon it. This particular
version of the popular belief may have sprung from the
fact that there is a rock off the coast of Brittany called
&lsquo;the Ship,&rsquo; from a fancied resemblance to one. In
course of time this rock was affirmed to have been the
ship of St Vougas.</p>
<h3><i>AzÃ©nor the Pale</i></h3>
<p>There is a story of another AzÃ©nor, who, according to
local history, married Yves, heritor of Kermorvan, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
year 1400. A popular ballad of Cornouaille tells how
this AzÃ©nor, who was surnamed &lsquo;the Pale,&rsquo; did not love
her lord, but gave her heart to another, the Clerk of
MezlÃ©an.</p>
<p>One day she sat musing by a forest fountain, dressed in
a robe of yellow silk, wantonly plucking the flowers
which grew on the mossy parapet of the spring and
binding them into a bouquet for the Clerk of MezlÃ©an.</p>
<p>The Seigneur Yves, passing by on his white steed at
a hand-gallop, observed her &ldquo;with the corner of his
eye,&rdquo; and conceived a violent love for her.</p>
<p>The Clerk of MezlÃ©an had been true to AzÃ©nor for many
a day, but he was poor and her parents would have none
of him.</p>
<p>One morning as AzÃ©nor descended to the courtyard she
observed great preparations on foot as if for a festival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has this great fire been
kindled, and why have they placed two spits in front of
it? What is happening in this house, and why have
these fiddlers come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those whom she asked smiled meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow is your wedding-day,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>At this AzÃ©nor the Pale grew still paler, and was long
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it will be well that I seek my
marriage chamber early, for from my bed I shall not be
raised except for burial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night her little page stole through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a great and brilliant company come
hither. The Seigneur Yves is at their head, and behind
him ride cavaliers and a long train of gentlemen. He
is mounted on a white horse, with trappings of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AzÃ©nor wept sorely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy the hour that he comes!&rdquo; she cried, wringing
her hands. &ldquo;Unhappy be my father and mother who
have done this thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorely wept AzÃ©nor when going to the church that day.
She set forth with her intended husband, riding on the
crupper of his horse. Passing by MezlÃ©an she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray you let me enter this house, Seigneur, for I am
fatigued with the journey, and would rest for a space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may not be to-day,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;to-morrow, if
you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this AzÃ©nor wept afresh, but was comforted by her
little page. At the church door one could see that her
heart was breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approach, my daughter,&rdquo; said the aged priest. &ldquo;Draw
near, that I may place the ring upon your finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; replied AzÃ©nor, &ldquo;I beg of you not to force
me to wed him whom I do not love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are wicked words, my child. The Seigneur
Yves is wealthy, he has gold and silver, chÃ¢teaux and
broad lands, but the Clerk of MezlÃ©an is poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor he may be, Father,&rdquo; murmured AzÃ©nor, &ldquo;yet had
I rather beg my bread with him than dwell softly with
this other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her relentless parents would not hearken to her
protestations, and she was wed to the Lord Yves. On
arriving at her husband&rsquo;s house she was met by the
Seigneur&rsquo;s mother, who received her graciously, but
only one word did AzÃ©nor speak, that old refrain that
runs through all ballad poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O my mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is my bed made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, my child,&rdquo; replied the chÃ¢telaine. &ldquo;It is next
the Chamber of the Black Cavalier. Follow me and I
will take you thither.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span></div>
<p>Once within the chamber, AzÃ©nor, wounded to the soul,
fell upon her knees, her fair hair falling about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;have pity upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Seigneur Yves sought out his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother of mine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sleeps in her high chamber,&rdquo; replied his mother.
&ldquo;Go to her and console her, for she is sadly in need of
comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Seigneur entered. &ldquo;Do you sleep?&rdquo; he asked
AzÃ©nor.</p>
<p>She turned in her bed and looked fixedly at him.
&ldquo;Good morrow to you, widower,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the saints,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;what mean you? Why do
you call me widower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seigneur,&rdquo; she said meaningly, &ldquo;it is true that you are
not a widower yet, but soon you will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, her mind wandering, she continued: &ldquo;Here is my
wedding gown; give it, I pray you, to my little servant,
who has been so good to me and who carried my letters
to the Clerk of MezlÃ©an. Here is a new cloak which
my mother broidered; give it to the priests who will
sing Masses for my soul. For yourself you may take
my crown and chaplet. Keep them well, I pray, as a
souvenir of our wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who is that who arrives at the hamlet as the clocks are
striking the hour? Is it the Clerk of MezlÃ©an? Too
late! AzÃ©nor is dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the fountain beside which AzÃ©nor plucked
flowers to make a bouquet for her &lsquo;sweet Clerk of
MezlÃ©an,&rsquo;&rdquo; says the Vicomte Hersart de la VillemarquÃ©,
&ldquo;when the Seigneur of Kermorvan passed and withered
with his glance her happiness and these flowers of
love. MezlÃ©an is in ruins, no one remains within its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
gates, surmounted by a crenellated and machicolated
gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a subscription at the end of the ballad to the
effect that it was written on a round table in the Manor
of HÃ©nan, near Pont-Aven, by the &ldquo;bard of the old
Seigneur,&rdquo; who dictated it to a damsel. &ldquo;How comes
it,&rdquo; asks VillemarquÃ©, &ldquo;that in the Middle Ages we
still find a seigneur of Brittany maintaining a domestic
bard?&rdquo; There is no good reason why a domestic bard
should not have been found in the Brittany of medieval
times, since such singers of the household were maintained
in Ireland and Scotland until a relatively late
date&mdash;up to the period of the &rsquo;45 in the case of the
latter country.</p>
<h3><i>St Pol of LÃ©on</i></h3>
<p>St Pol (or Paul) of LÃ©on (sixth century) was the son
of a Welsh prince, and, like so many of the Breton
saints, he was a disciple of St Iltud, being also a fellow-student
of St Samson and St Gildas. At the age of
sixteen he left his home and crossed the sea to Brittany.
In the course of time other young men congregated
round him, and he became their superior, receiving holy
orders along with twelve companions. Near these
young monks dwelt Mark, the King of Vannes, who
invited Pol to visit his territory and instruct his people.
The Saint went to Vannes and was well received, but
after dwelling for some time in that part of the country
he felt the need of solitude once more, and entreated
the King that he might have permission to depart and
that he might be given a bell; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; as the chronicler
tells us, &ldquo;at that time it was customary for kings to
have seven bells rung before they sat down to meat.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></div>
<p>The King, however, vexed that Pol should wish to
leave him, refused to give him the bell, so the Saint
went without it. Before leaving Vannes Pol visited
his sister, who lived in solitude with other holy women
on a little island, but when the time came for him to
depart she wept and entreated him to stay, and the
Saint remained with her for another three days. When
he was finally taking leave of her, she begged him
that as he was &ldquo;powerful with God&rdquo; he would grant
her a request, and when Pol asked what it was she
desired him to do, she explained that the island on
which she dwelt was small &ldquo;and incommodious for
landing&rdquo; and requested him to pray to God that it
might be extended a little into the sea, with a &ldquo;gentle
shore.&rdquo; Pol said she had asked what was beyond his
power, but suggested that they should pray that her
desire might be granted. So they prayed, and the
sea began to retreat, &ldquo;leaving smooth, golden sand
where before there had been only stormy waves.&rdquo; All
the nuns came to see the miracle which had been
wrought, and the sister of St Pol gathered pebbles and
laid them round the land newly laid bare, and strewed
them down the road that she and her brother had
taken. These pebbles grew into tall pillars of rock,
and the avenue thus formed is to this day called &lsquo;the
Road of St Pol.&rsquo; Thus do the peasants explain the
Druidical circles and avenue on the islet.</p>
<p>After this miracle Pol departed, and rowed to the island
of Ouessant, and later he travelled through Brittany,
finally settling in the island of Batz, near the small
town encompassed by mud walls which has since borne
his name. There he founded a monastery. The island
was at that time infested by a dreadful monster, sixty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
feet long, and we are told how the Saint subdued this
dragon. Accompanied by a warrior, he entered its
den, tied his stole round its neck, and, giving it to his
companion to lead, he followed them, beating the animal
with his stick, until they came to the extremity of the
island. There he took off the stole and commanded
the dragon to fling itself into the sea&mdash;an order which
the monster immediately obeyed. In the church on
the island a stole is preserved which is said to be
that of St Pol. Another story tells us how St Jaoua,
nephew of St Pol, had to call in his uncle&rsquo;s aid in taming
a wild bull which was devastating his cell. These
incidents remind us of St Efflam&rsquo;s taming of the dragon.
St Pol is one of the saints famous for his miraculous
power over wild beasts.</p>
<p>The Saint&rsquo;s renown became such that the Breton king
made him Archbishop of LÃ©on, giving him special care
and control of the city bearing his name. We are told
how the Saint found wild bees swarming in a hollow
tree, and, gathering the swarm, set them in a hive and
taught the people how to get honey. He also found
a wild sow with her litter and tamed them. The
descendants of this progeny remained at LÃ©on for many
generations, and were regarded as royal beasts. Both
of these stories are, of course, a picturesque way of
saying that St Pol taught the people to cultivate bees
and to keep pigs.</p>
<p>St Pol&rsquo;s early desire to possess a bell was curiously
granted later, as one day when he was in the company
of a Count who ruled the land under King Childebat
a fisherman brought the Count a bell which he had
picked up on the seashore. The Count gave it to
St Pol, who smiled and told him how he had longed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
and waited for years for such a bell. In the cathedral
at Saint-Pol-de-LÃ©on is a tiny bell which is said to have
belonged to St Pol, and on the days of pardon &ldquo;its notes
still ring out over the heads of the faithful,&rdquo; and are supposed
to be efficacious in curing headache or earache.</p>
<p>In the cathedral choir is the tomb of St Pol, where
&ldquo;his skull, an arm-bone, and a finger are encased in
a little coffer, for the veneration of the devout.&rdquo; St Pol
built the cathedral at LÃ©on, and was its first bishop.
Strategy had to be resorted to to secure the see for
him. The Count gave Pol a letter to take in person
to King Childebat, which stated that he had sent Pol
to be ordained bishop and invested with the see of
LÃ©on. When the Saint discovered what the letter
contained he wept, and implored the King to respect
his great disinclination to become a bishop; but
Childebat would not listen, and, calling for three bishops,
he had him consecrated. The Saint was received
with great joy by the people of LÃ©on, and lived among
them to a green old age.</p>
<p>In art St Pol is most generally represented with a
dragon, and sometimes with a bell, or a cruse of water
and a loaf of bread, symbolical of his frugal habits.</p>
<h3><i>St Ronan</i></h3>
<p>Of St Ronan there is told a tale of solemn warning to
wives addicted to neglecting their children and &ldquo;seeking
their pleasure elsewhere,&rdquo; as it is succinctly expressed.
St Ronan was an Irish bishop who came to LÃ©on, where
he retired into a hermitage in the forest of NÃ©vet.
Grallo, the King of Brittany, was in the habit of visiting
him in his cell, listening to his discourses, and putting
theological questions to him. The domestic question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
must have been a problem even in those days, since we
find Grallo&rsquo;s Queen, Queban, in charge of her five-year-old
daughter. Family cares proving rather irksome,
Queban solved the difficulty of her daughter by putting
the child into a box, with bread and milk to keep her
quiet, while she amused herself with frivolous matters.
Unfortunately, this ingeniously improvized <i>crÃªche</i> proved
singularly unsuccessful, for the poor little girl choked
on a piece of crust, and when the Queen next visited
the child she found to her horror that she was dead.
Terrified at the fatal result of her neglect, and not daring
to confess what had happened, the Queen, being a
woman of resource, closed the box and raised a hue and
cry to find the girl, who she declared must have strayed.</p>
<p>She rushed in search of her husband to St Ronan&rsquo;s cell,
and upbraided the hermit for being the cause of the
King&rsquo;s absence. &ldquo;But for you,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;my
daughter would not have been lost!&rdquo; But it was a
fatal mistake to accuse the Saint, or to imagine that he
could be deceived. Sternly rebuking her, he challenged
her with the fact that the child lay dead in a box, with
milk and bread beside her! Rising, he left his cell,
and, followed by the agitated royal couple, he led the
way to where the proof of the Queen&rsquo;s neglect and deceit
was found. Small mercy was shown in those days to
erring womanhood, and the guilty Queen was instantly
&ldquo;stoned with stones till she died.&rdquo; The Saint completed
his share in the matter by casting himself on his knees
beside the child, whereupon she was restored to life.</p>
<h3><i>St Goezenou</i></h3>
<p>St Goezenou (<i>circ.</i> <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 675) was a native of Britain whose
parents crossed to Brittany and settled near Brest, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
the Saint built an oratory and cabin for himself. The
legend runs that the prince of the neighbourhood having
offered to give him as much land as he could surround
with a ditch in one day, the Saint took a fork and
dragged it along the ground after him as he walked, in
this way enclosing a league and a half of land, the
fork as it trailed behind him making a furrow and
throwing up an embankment, on a small scale. This
story is quite probably a popular tradition, which grew
up to explain the origin of old military earthworks in
that part of the country, which were afterward utilized
by the monks of St Goezenou.</p>

QUEEN QUEBAN STONED TO DEATH<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>It is also related of this worthy Saint that he had such
a horror of women that he set up a huge menhir to
mark the boundary beyond which no female was to pass
under penalty of death. On one occasion a woman,
either to test the extent of the Saint&rsquo;s power or from
motives of enmity, pushed another woman who was with
her past this landmark; but the innocent trespasser was
unhurt and her assailant fell dead.</p>
<p>On one occasion, we are told, Goezenou asked a farmer&rsquo;s
wife for some cream cheeses, but the woman, not wishing
to part with them, declared that she had none. &ldquo;You
speak the truth,&rdquo; said the Saint. &ldquo;You had some, but if
you will now look in your cupboard you will find they
have been turned into stone,&rdquo; and when the ungenerous
housewife ran to her cupboard she found that this
was so! The petrified cheeses were long preserved in
the church of Goezenou&mdash;being removed during the
Revolution, and afterward preserved in the manor of
Kergivas.</p>
<p>Goezenou governed his church for twenty-four years,
till he met with a violent death. Accompanied by his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
brother St Magan, he went to QuimperlÃ© to see the
monastery which St Corbasius was building there, but
he began to praise the architecture of his own church,
and this so enraged the master builder that he dropped
his hammer on the critic&rsquo;s head. To add to the grief
of St Magan, St Corbasius endeavoured to appropriate
the body of the murdered Saint. He consented, however,
to allow St Magan to have such bones as he was
able to identify as belonging to his brother, whereupon
St Magan prayed all night, and next morning spread a
sheet for the bones, which miraculously arranged themselves
into an entire skeleton, which the sorrowing Magan
was thus enabled to remove.</p>
<h3><i>St Winwaloe, or Gwenaloe</i></h3>
<p>St Winwaloe, born about 455, was the son of Fragan,
Governor of LÃ©on, who had married a wealthy lady
named Gwen. Their son was so beautiful that they
named him Gwenaloe, or &lsquo;He that is white.&rsquo; When
the lad was about fifteen years old he was given to
the care of a holy man, with whom he lived on the islet
called Ile-Verte. One day a pirate fleet was sighted off
the coast, near the harbour of Guic-sezne, and Winwaloe,
who was with his father at the time, is said to have
exclaimed, &ldquo;I see a thousand sails,&rdquo; and to this day
a cross which marks the spot is called &lsquo;the Cross of
the Thousand Sails,&rsquo; to commemorate the victory which
Fragan and his son won over the pirates, who landed
but were utterly defeated by the Governor and his
retainers. During the fight Winwaloe, &ldquo;like a second
Moses,&rdquo; prayed for victory, and when the victory had
been won he entreated his father to put the booty
gained to a holy use and to build a monastery on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
site of the battle. This was done, and the monastery
was called Loc-Christ.</p>
<p>Leaving his master after some years, Winwaloe settled
on the island of Sein, but finding that it was exposed
to the fury of every gale that blew from the Atlantic
he left it and went to LandÃ©vennec, on the opposite side
of the harbour at Brest. There he established a monastery,
gathered round him many disciples, and dwelt
there until his death, many years later. He died during
the first week of Lent, &ldquo;after bestowing a kiss of peace
on his brethren,&rdquo; and his body is preserved at Montreuil-sur-Mer,
his chasuble, alb, and bell being laid in the
Jesuit church of St Charles at Antwerp.</p>
<p>In art St Winwaloe is represented vested as an abbot,
with staff in one hand and a bell in the other, standing
beside the sea, from which fishes arise as if in answer
to the sound of his bell.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIII_COSTUMES_AND_CUSTOMS_OF_BRITTANY' id='CHAPTER_XIII_COSTUMES_AND_CUSTOMS_OF_BRITTANY'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII: COSTUMES AND CUSTOMS OF BRITTANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Distinctive</span> national costume has to a great
extent become a thing of the past in Europe,
and for this relinquishment of the picturesque
we have doubtless in a measure to thank the exploitation
of remote districts as tourist and sporting centres.
Brittany, however, has been remarkably faithful to her
sartorial traditions, and even to-day in the remoter parts
of the west and in distant sea-coast places her men and
women have not ceased to express outwardly the strong
national and personal individuality of their race. In
these districts it is still possible for the traveller to take
a sudden, bewildering, and wholly entrancing step back
into the past.</p>
<p>In Cornouaille the national costume is more jealously
cherished than in any other part of the country, even to
the smallest details, for here the men carry a <i>pen-bas</i>, or
cudgel, which is as much a supplement to their attire
and as characteristic of it as the Irish shillelagh is of
the traditional Irish dress. Quimper is perhaps second
to Cornouaille in fidelity to the old costume, for all the
men wear the national habit. On gala days this consists
of gaily embroidered and coloured waistcoats, which
often bear the travelling tailor&rsquo;s name, and voluminous
<i>bragou-bras</i>, or breeches of blue or brown, held at
the waist with a broad leather belt with a metal buckle
and caught in at the knee with ribbons of various hues,
the whole set off with black leather leggings and shoes
ornamented with silver buckles. A broad-brimmed
hat, beneath which the hair falls down sometimes to
below the shoulders, finishes a toilet which on weekdays
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
or work-days has to give place to white <i>bragou-bras</i> of
tough material, something more sombre in waistcoats,
and the ever serviceable sabot.</p>
<h3><i>Hats and Hymen</i></h3>
<p>In the vast stretch of the salt-pans of Escoublac, between
Batz and Le Croisic, where the entire population of the
district is employed, the workers, or <i>paludiers</i>, affect a
smock-frock with pockets, linen breeches, gaiters, and
shoes all of white, and with this dazzling costume they
wear a huge, flapping black hat turned up on one side to
form a horn-shaped peak. This peak is very important,
as it indicates the state of the wearer, the young bachelor
adjusting it with great nicety over the ear, the widower
above his forehead, and the married man at the back of
his head. On Sundays or gala-days, however, this
uniform is discarded in favour of a multicoloured and
more distinctive attire, the breeches being of fine cloth,
exceedingly full and pleated and finished with ribbons
at the knees, the gaiters and white shoes of everyday
giving place to white woollen stockings with clocks
embroidered on them and shoes of light yellow, while
the smock is supplanted by several waistcoats of varying
lengths and shades, which are worn one above the other
in different coloured tiers, finished at the neck with a
turnover muslin collar. The holiday hat is the same,
save for a roll of brightly and many tinted chenille.</p>
<p>Several petticoats of pleated cloth, big bibs or plastrons
called <i>piÃ¨ces</i>, of the same shade as their dresses, and
a shawl with a fringed border, compose the costume of
the women. The aprons of the girls are very plain and
devoid of pockets, but the older women&rsquo;s are rich in
texture and design, some of them being of silk and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
others even of costly brocade. The women&rsquo;s head-dress
is almost grotesque in its originality, the hair being woven
into two rolls, swathed round with tape, and wound into
a coronet across the head. Over this is drawn tightly
a kind of cap, which forms a peak behind and is crossed
in front like a handkerchief. Should widowhood overtake
a woman she relinquishes this <i>coiffe</i> and shrouds
her head and shoulders in a rough black triangular-shaped
sheepskin mantle.</p>
<p>The toilette of a bride is as magnificent as the widow&rsquo;s
is depressing and dowdy. It consists of three different
dresses, the first of white velvet with apron of moire-antique,
the second of purple velvet, and the third of
cloth of gold with embroidered sleeves, with a <i>piÃ¨ce</i> of
the same material. A wide sash, embroidered with
gold, is used for looping up all these resplendent skirts
in order to reveal the gold clocks which adorn the
stockings. These, and all gala costumes, are carefully
stored away at the village inn, and may be seen by
the traveller sufficiently interested to pay a small fee
for the privilege.</p>
<h3><i>Quaint Head-dresses</i></h3>
<p>Though the dress of the Granville women does not
attempt to equal or rival the magnificence just described,
nevertheless it is as quaint and characteristic. They
favour a long black or very dark coat, with bordering
frills of the same material and shade, and their cap is
a sort of <i>bandeau</i>, turning up sharply at the ears, and
crested by a white handkerchief folded square and laid
flat on top.</p>
<p>In Ouessant the peasant women adopt an Italian style
of costume, their head-dress, from under which their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
hair falls loosely, being exactly in almost every detail
like that which one associates with the women of Italy.
The costume of the man from St Pol is, like that of
the Granville women, soberer than most others of
Brittany. Save for his buttons, the buckle on his hat,
and the clasps of white metal fastening his leather shoes,
his dress, including spencer, waistcoat, trousers, and
stockings, is of black, and his hair is worn falling on
his shoulders, while he rarely carries the <i>pen-bas</i>&mdash;an
indication, perhaps, of his rather meditative, pious
temperament.</p>
<p>At Villecheret the cap of the women is bewilderingly
varied and very peculiar. At first sight it appears to
consist of several large sheets of stiff white paper, in
some cases a sheet of the apparent paper spreading out
at either side of the head and having another roll placed
across it; in other cases a ridged roof seems to rest
upon the hair, a roof with the sides rolling upward and
fastened at the top with a frail thread; while a third
type of head-dress is of the skull-cap order, from which
is suspended two ties quite twenty inches long and eight
inches wide, which are doubled back midway and
fastened again to the top of the skull-cap. The unmarried
woman who adopts this <i>coiffe</i> must wear the
ties hanging over the shoulders.</p>
<p>Originality in head-dress the male peasant leaves almost
entirely to the woman, for nearly everywhere in Brittany
one meets with the long, wide-brimmed, black hat, with
a black band, the dullness of which is relieved by a
white or blue metal buckle, as large as those usually
found on belts. To this rule the Plougastel man is one
of the exceptions, wearing a red cap with his trousers
and coat of white flannel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></div>
<p>At Muzillac, some miles distant from La Roche-Bernard,
the women supplant the white <i>coiffe</i> with a huge black
cap resembling the cowl of a friar, while at Pont l&rsquo;AbbÃ©
and along the Bay of Audierne the cap or <i>bigouden</i> is
formed of two pieces, the first a species of skull-cap
fitting closely over the head and ears, the second a
small circular piece of starched linen, shaped into a
three-cornered peak, the centre point being embroidered
and kept in position by a white tape tie which fastens
under the chin. Over the skull-cap the hair is dressed
<i>en chignon</i>. The dress accompanying this singular
<i>coiffe</i> and <i>coiffure</i> has a large yellow <i>piÃ¨ce</i>, with sleeves
to match. The men wear a number of short coats, one
above the other, the shortest and last being trimmed
with a fringe, and occasionally ornamented with sentences
embroidered in coloured wools round the border, describing
the patriotic or personal sentiments of the wearer.</p>
<p>The women of Morlaix are also partial to the tight-fitting
<i>coiffe</i>. This consists of five broad folds, forming
a base from which a fan-like fall of stiffened calico
spreads out from ear to ear, completely shading the
nape of the neck and reaching down the back below
the shoulders. Many of the women wear calico tippets,
while the more elderly affect a sort of mob-cap with
turned-up edges, from which to the middle of the head
are stretched two wide straps of calico, joined together
at the ends with a pin. Most of the youths of Morlaix
wear the big, flapping hat, but very often a black
cloth cap is also seen. This is ridiculous rather than
picturesque, for so long is it that with almost every
movement it tips over the wearer&rsquo;s nose. The tunic
accompanying either hat or cap is of blue flannel, and
over it is worn a black waistcoat. The porters of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
market-places wear a sort of smock. The young boys
of Morlaix dress very like their elders, and nearly all
of them wear the long loose cap, with the difference
that a tasselled end dangles down the back.</p>

MODERN BRITTANY<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>On religious festivals the gala dress is always donned
in all vicinities of Brittany, and the costume informs
the initiated at once in what capacity the Breton is
present. For instance, the <i>porteuses</i>, or banner-bearers,
of certain saints are dressed in white; others may be
more gorgeously or vividly attired in gowns of bright-coloured
silk trimmed with gold lace, scarves of silver
thread, aprons of gold tissue or brocade, and lace <i>coiffes</i>
over caps of gold or silver tissue; while some, though
in national gala dress, will have flags or crosses to distinguish
them from the more commonplace worshipper.</p>
<h3><i>Religious Festivals</i></h3>
<p>This dressing for the part and the occasion is interwoven
with the Breton&rsquo;s existence as unalterably as
sacred and profane elements are into the occasions of
his religious festivals. A feast day well and piously
begun is interspersed and concluded with a gaiety and
abandon which by contrast strikes a note of profanity.
Yet Brittany is quite the most devotedly religious of
all the French provinces, and one may see the great
cathedrals filled to their uttermost with congregations
including as many men as women. Nowhere else,
perhaps, will one find such great masses of people so
completely lost in religious fervour during the usual
Church services and the grander and more impressive
festivals so solemnly observed. This reverence is attributed
by some to the power of superstition, by others
to the Celtic temperament of the worshippers; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
from whatever cause it arises no one who has lived
among the Bretons can doubt the sincerity and childlike
faith which lies at the base of it all, a faith of which
a medieval simplicity and credence are the keynotes.</p>
<h3><i>The Pardons</i></h3>
<p>This pious punctiliousness is not confined to Church
services and ceremonies alone, for rarely are wayside
crosses or shrines unattended by some simple peasant
or peasants telling beads or unfolding griefs to a God
Who, they have been taught, takes the deepest interest in
and compassionates all the troubles and trials which may
befall them. Between May and October the religious
ardour of the Breton may be witnessed at its strongest,
for during these months the five great &lsquo;Pardons&rsquo; or religious
pilgrimage festivals are solemnized in the following
sequence: the Pardon of the Poor, at Saint-Yves;
the Pardon of the Singers, at Rumengol; the Pardon of
the Fire, at Saint-Jean-du-Doigt; the Pardon of the
Mountain, at TromÃ©nie-de-Saint-Renan; the Pardon of
the Sea, at Sainte-Anne-la-Palud.</p>
<p>The Pardon of the Poor, the Pardon of the Singers, and
the Pardon of the Sea are especially rigorous and
exacting, but the less celebrated Pardon of Notre Dame
de la ClartÃ©, in Morbihan, has an earthly as much as a
celestial object, for while the pilgrimage does homage
to the Virgin it is at the same time believed to facilitate
marriage. Here, once the sacred side of the festival
has been duly observed, the young man in search of a
wife circles about the church, closely scrutinizing all
the eligible demoiselles who come within range of his
vision. As soon as he decides which maiden most
appeals to him, he asks her politely if she will accept a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
gift from him, and at the same time presents a large
round cake, with which he has armed himself for that
occasion. &ldquo;Will mademoiselle break the cake with
me?&rdquo; is the customary form of address, and in the
adoption or rejection of this suggestion lies the young
peasant&rsquo;s yea or nay.</p>
<p>The Pardon of Saint-Jean-du-Doigt takes place on the
22nd of June, and is, perhaps, the most solemn of these
festivals. During its celebration the relic of the Saint,
the little finger of his right hand, is held before the high
altar of the church by an <i>abbÃ©</i> clad in his surplice. The
finger is wrapped in the finest of linen, and one by one
the congregation files past the <i>abbÃ©</i> for the purpose of
touching for one brief moment the relic he holds. At
the same time another cleric stands near the choir,
holding the skull of St MÃ©riadec, and before this the
pilgrims also promenade, reverently bowing their heads
as they go. The devotees then repair to a side wall
near which there is a fountain, the waters of which have
been previously sanctified by bathing in them the finger
of St Jean suspended from a gold chain, and into this
the pilgrims plunge their palms and vigorously rub their
eyes with them, as a protection against blindness.
This concludes the religious side of the Pardon, and
immediately after its less edifying ceremonies begin.</p>
<p>The Pardon of the Mountain is held on Trinity Sunday
at TromÃ©nie. Every sixth year there is the &lsquo;Grand
TromÃ©nie,&rsquo; an event which draws an immense concourse
of people from all parts. The principal feature of this
great day from the spectator&rsquo;s point of view is the
afternoon procession. It is of the most imposing
description, and all who have come to take part in the
Pardon join it, as with banners flying and much hymn-singing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
it takes its way out of the town to wind round
a mountain in the vicinity.</p>
<h3><i>Barking Women</i></h3>
<p>In the old days of religious enthusiasm a remarkable
phenomenon often attended these festivals, when excitement
began to run high, as it was certain to do
among a Celtic people. This was the barking of
certain highly strung hysterical women. In time it
became quite a usual feature, but now, happily, it is a
part of the ceremony which has almost entirely disappeared.
There is a legend in connexion with this
custom that the Virgin appeared before some women
disguised as a beggar, and asked for a draught of water,
and, when they refused it, caused them and their posterity
to be afflicted with the mania.</p>
<h3><i>The Sacring Bell</i></h3>
<p>Another custom of earlier times was that of ringing
the sacring bell. These bells are very tiny, and are
attached at regular intervals to the outer rim of a
wooden wheel, wrongly styled by some &lsquo;the Wheel of
Fortune,&rsquo; from which dangles a long string. In most
places the sacring bell is kept as a curiosity, though in
the church of St Bridget at Berhet the <i>Sant-e-roa</i>, or
Holy Wheel, is still rung by pilgrims during Mass.
The bells are set pealing through the medium of a long
string by the impatient suppliant, to remind the saint to
whom the <i>Sant-e-roa</i> may be dedicated of the prayerful
requests with which he or she has been assailed.</p>
<p>There are in many of the churches of Brittany wide,
old-fashioned fireplaces, a fact which testifies to a very
sensible practice which prevailed in the latter half of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
the sixteenth century&mdash;that of warming the baptismal
water before applying it to the defenceless head of the
lately born. The most famous of these old fireplaces
belong to the churches of St Bridget in Perguet, Le
Moustoir-le-Juch, St Non at Penmarch, and BrÃ©vÃ©lenz.
In the church at the latter place one of the pinnacles of
the porch forms the chimney to its historic hearth.</p>
<h3><i>The Venus of Quinipily</i></h3>
<p>Childless people often pay a visit to some standing
stone in their neighbourhood in the hope that they
may thereby be blessed with offspring. Famous in this
respect is the &lsquo;Venus,&rsquo; or <i>Groabgoard</i>, of Quinipily, a
rough-hewn stone in the likeness of a goddess. The
letters <span class='smcaplc'>...LIT...</span> still remain on it&mdash;part of a Latin
inscription which has been thought to have originally
read <span class='smcaplc'>ILITHVIA</span>, &ldquo;a name in keeping with the rites still
in use before the image,&rdquo; says MacCulloch.<a name='FNanchor_0061' id='FNanchor_0061'></a><a href='#Footnote_0061' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a></p>
<h3><i>Holy Wells</i></h3>
<p>The holy well is another institution dating from early
days, and there is hardly a church in Brittany which
does not boast one or more of these shrines, which are
in most cases dedicated to the saint in whose honour the
church has been raised. So numerous are these wells
that to name them and dwell at any length on the
curative powers claimed for their waters would fill a
large volume. Worthy of mention, however, is the
Holy Well of St Bieuzy, as typical of most of such
sacred springs. It is close to the church of the same
name in Bieuzy, and flows from a granite wall. Its
waters are said to relieve and cure the mentally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
deranged. Some of the wells are large enough to permit
the afflicted to bathe in their waters, and of these the
well near the church of Goezenou is a good example.
It is situated in an enclosure surrounded by stone seats
for the convenience of the devotees who may desire to
immerse themselves bodily in it. Several of these
shrines bear dates, but whether they are genuine is a
matter for conjecture.</p>
<h3><i>Reliquaries</i></h3>
<p>Every Breton churchyard worthy of the name has its
reliquary or bone-house. There may be seen rows of
small boxes like dog-kennels with heart-shaped openings.
Round these openings, names, dates, and pious ejaculations
are written. Looking through the aperture, a
glimpse of a skull may startle one, for it is a gruesome
custom of the country to dig up the bones of the dead
and preserve the skulls in this way. The name upon
the box is that once borne by the deceased, the date
that of his death, and the charitable prayer is for the
repose of his soul. Occasionally these boxes are set in
conspicuous places in the church, but generally they
remain in the reliquary. In the porch of the church of
St TrÃ©meur, the son of the notorious Breton Bluebeard,
Comorre, there is one of the largest collections of these
receptacles in Brittany. Rich people who may have
endowed or founded sacred edifices are buried in an
arched recess of the abbey or church they have benefited.</p>
<h3><i>Feeding the Dead</i></h3>
<p>In some parts of Brittany hollows are found in tombstones
above graves, and these are annually filled with
holy water or libations of milk. It would seem as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
this custom linked prehistoric with modern practice and
that the cup-hollows frequently met with on the top of
dolmens may have been intended as receptacles for the
food of the dead. The basins scooped in the soil of a
barrow may have served the same purpose. On the
night of All Souls&rsquo; Day, when this libation is made, the
supper is left spread on the table of each cottage and
the fire burns brightly, so that the dead may return to
refresh and warm themselves after the dolours of the
grave.</p>
<h3><i>The Passage de l&rsquo;Enfer</i></h3>
<p>How hard custom dies in Brittany is illustrated by the
fact that it is still usual at TrÃ©guier to convey the
dead to the churchyard in a boat over a part of
the river called the &lsquo;Passage de l&rsquo;Enfer,&rsquo; instead of
taking the shorter way by land. This custom is
reminiscent of what Procopius, a historian of the sixth
century, says regarding Breton Celtic custom in his
<i>De Bello Gothico</i>. Speaking of the island of Brittia,
by which he means Britain, he states that it is
divided by a wall. Thither fishermen from the Breton
coast are compelled to ferry over at darkest night the
shades of the dead, unseen by them, but marshalled by
a mysterious leader. The fishermen who are to row
the dead across to the British coast must go to bed early,
for at midnight they are aroused by a tapping at the door,
and they are called in a low voice. They rise and go
down to the shore, attracted by some force which they
cannot explain. Here they find their boats, apparently
empty, yet the water rises to the bulwarks, as if they
were crowded. Once they commence the voyage their
vessels cleave the water speedily, making the passage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
usually a day and a half&rsquo;s sailing, in an hour. When
the British shore is reached the souls of the dead leave
the boats, which at once rise in the sea as if unloaded.
Then a loud voice on shore is heard calling out the
name and style of those who have disembarked.</p>
<p>Procopius had, of course, heard the old Celtic myth of
an oversea Elysium, and had added to it some distorted
reminiscence of the old Roman wall which divided
Britain. The &lsquo;ship of souls&rsquo; is evidently a feature of
Celtic as well as of Latin and Greek belief.</p>
<h3><i>Calvaries</i></h3>
<p>Calvaries, or representations of the passion on the
Cross, are most frequently encountered in Brittany,
so much so, indeed, that it has been called &lsquo;the Land
of the Calvaries.&rsquo; Over the length and breadth of the
country they are to be met at almost every turn, some
of them no more than rude, simple crosses originating
in local workshops, and others truly magnificent in
carving and detail. Some of the most famous are those
situated at Plougastel, Saint-ThÃ©gonnec, and Guimiliau.</p>
<p>The Calvary of Plougastel dates from the early
sixteenth century, and consists of an arcade beneath
a platform filled with statues. The surrounding frieze
has carvings in bas-relief representing incidents in the
life of Christ. The Calvary of Saint-ThÃ©gonnec represents
vividly the phases of the passion, being really a
&lsquo;way of the Cross&rsquo; in sculpture. It bears the unmistakable
stamp of the sixteenth century. The Calvary of
Guimiliau is dated 1580 and 1588. A platform supported
by arches bears the three crosses, the four evangelists,
and other figures connected with the principal incidents
in the life and passion of our Lord. The principal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
figures, that of Christ and those of the attending
Blessed Virgin and St John, are most beautifully and
sympathetically portrayed. The figures in the representations
from the life of Christ, which are from necessity
much smaller than those of the Crucifixion, are dressed
in the costume of the sixteenth century. The entire
Calvary is sculptured in Kersanton stone.</p>

THE SOULS OF THE DEAD<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Whether these and other similar groups are really
works of art is perhaps a matter for discussion, but
regarding their impressiveness there cannot be two
opinions. By the bulk of the people they are held
in great reverence, and rarely are they unattended by
tiny congregations of two or three, while on the occasion
of important religious festivals people flock to them in
hundreds.</p>
<h3><i>Weddings</i></h3>
<p>In many of their religious observances the Bretons are
prone to confuse the sacred with the profane, and chief
among these is the wedding ceremony&mdash;the customs
attendant on which in some ostensibly Christian countries
are yet a disgrace to the intellect as well as the good
feeling of man. In rural Brittany, however, the revelry
which ensues as soon as the church door closes on the
newly wedded pair is more like that associated with
a children&rsquo;s party than the recreation of older people.
Should the marriage be celebrated in the morning,
tables laid out with cakes are ranged outside the church
door, and when the bridal procession files out of the
church the bride and bridegroom each take a cake from
the table and leave a coin in its stead for the poor.
The guests follow suit, and then the whole party repairs
to the nearest meadow, where endless <i>ronds</i> are begun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span></div>
<p>The <i>rond</i> is a sort of dance in which the whole assembly
joins hands and revolves slowly with a hop-skip-and-a-jump
step to the accompaniment of a most wearisome
and unvarying chant, the music for which is provided
by the <i>biniou</i>, or bagpipe, and the flageolet or hautboy,
both being occasionally augmented by the drum. Before
the ceremony begins the musicians who are responsible
for this primitive harmony are dispatched to summon
the guests, who, of course, arrive in the full splendour
of the national gala costume. As soon as the <i>ronds</i> are
completed to the satisfaction of everybody the custom
common to so many countries of stealing the bride away
is celebrated. At a given signal she speeds away from
the party, hotly pursued by the young gallants present,
and when she is overtaken she presents the successful
swain with a cup of coffee at a public <i>cafÃ©</i>. This interlude
is followed by dinner, and after that the <i>ronds</i> are
resumed. These festivities, in the case of prosperous
people, sometimes last three days, during which time
the guests are entertained at their host&rsquo;s expense. If
the wedding happens to be held in the evening, dancing
is about the only amusement indulged in, and this
follows an elaborate wedding supper. The <i>biniou</i> and
its companions are decidedly <i>en Ã©vidence</i>, while sometimes
the monotony of the <i>ronds</i> is varied by the <i>grand
rond</i>, a much more graceful and intricate affair, containing
many elaborate and difficult steps; but the more
ordinary dance is the favourite, probably because of the
difficulties attending the other.</p>
<h3><i>Breton Burials</i></h3>
<p>An ancient Breton funeral ceremony was replete with
symbolic meaning and ritual, which have been carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
down through the Middle Ages to the present time.
As soon as the head of the family had ceased to breathe,
a great fire was lit in the courtyard, and the mattress
upon which he had expired was burned. Pitchers of
water and milk were emptied, for fear, perhaps, that
the soul of the defunct might be athirst. The dead
man was then enveloped from head to foot in a great
white sheet and placed in a description of funeral
pavilion, the hands joined on the breast, the body
turned toward the east. At his feet a little stool was
placed, and two yellow candles were lit on each side
of him. Then the beadle or gravedigger, who was
usually a poor man, went round the country-side to carry
the news of death, which he usually called out in a high,
piping voice, ringing his little bell the while. At the
hour of sunset people arrived from all parts for the
purpose of viewing the body. Each one carried a
branch, which he placed on the feet of the defunct.</p>
<p>The evening prayer was recited by all, then the
women sang the canticles. From time to time the
widow and children of the deceased raised the corner
of the shroud and kissed it solemnly. A repast was
served in an adjoining room, where the beggar sat
side by side with the wealthy, on the principle that
all were equal before death. It is strange that the
poor are always associated with the griefs as with
the pleasures of Breton people; we find them at the
feast of death and at the baptism as at the wedding
rejoicing.</p>
<p>In the morning the rector of the parish arrived and all
retired, with the exception of the parents, if these
chanced to be alive, in whose presence the beadle
closed the coffin. No other member of the family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
was permitted to take part in this solemn farewell,
which was regarded as a sacred duty. The coffin
was then placed on a car drawn by oxen, and the
funeral procession set out, preceded by the clergy
and followed by the female relations of the deceased,
wearing yellow head-dresses and black mantles. The
men followed with bared heads. On arriving at the
church the coffin was disposed on trestles, and the widow
sat close by it throughout the ceremony. As it was
lowered into the tomb the last words of the prayer for
the dead were repeated by all, and as it touched the
soil beneath a loud cry arose from the bereaved.</p>
<p>The Breton funeral ceremony, like those prevalent
among other Celtic peoples, is indeed a lugubrious
affair, and somewhat recalls the Irish wake in its
strange mixture of mourning and feasting; but curiously
enough brightness reigns afterward, for the peasant is
absolutely assured that at the moment his friend is
placed in the tomb he commences a life of joy without
end.</p>
<h3><i>Tartarus and Paradise</i></h3>
<p>Two very striking old Breton ballads give us very vivid
pictures of the Breton idea of Heaven and its opposite.
That dealing with the infernal regions hails from the
district of LÃ©on. It is attributed to a priest named
Morin, who flourished in the fifteenth century, but
others have claimed it for a Jesuit father called Maunoir,
who lived and preached some two hundred years later.
In any case it bears the ecclesiastical stamp. &ldquo;Descend,
Christians,&rdquo; it begins, &ldquo;to see what unspeakable tortures
the souls of the condemned suffer through the justice of
God, Who has chained them in the midst of flames for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
having abused their gifts in this world. Hell is a profound
abyss, full of shadow, where not the least gleam
of light ever comes. The gates have been closed and
bolted by God, and He will never open them more.
The key is lost!</p>
<p>&ldquo;An oven heated to whiteness is this place, a fire
which constantly devours the lost souls. There they
will eternally burn, tormented by the intolerable heat.
They gnash their teeth like mad dogs; they cannot
escape the flames, which are over their heads, under
their feet, and on all sides. The son rushes at his
father, and the daughter at her mother. They drag
them by the hair through the midst of flames, with a
thousand maledictions, crying, &lsquo;Cursed be ye, lost
woman, who brought us into the world! Cursed be ye,
heedless man, who wert the cause of our damnation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For drink they have only their tears. Their skins are
scorched, and bitten by the teeth of serpents and
demons, and their flesh and their bones are nothing but
fuel to the great fire of Hell!</p>
<p>&ldquo;After they have been for some time in this furnace,
they are plunged by Satan into a lake of ice, and from
this they are thrown once more into the flames, and
from the flames into the water, like a bar of iron in a
smithy. &lsquo;Have pity, my God, have pity on us!&rsquo; they
call; but they weep in vain, for God has closed His
ears to their plaints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heat is so intense that their marrow burns within
their bones. The more they crave for pity, the more
they are tormented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fire is the anger of God which they have aroused;
verily it may never be put out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One turns with loathing, with anger, and with contempt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
from this production of medieval ecclesiasticism. When
one thinks of the thousands of simple and innocent
people who must have been tortured and driven half
wild with terror by such infamous utterances as this, one
feels inclined to challenge the oft-repeated statement
concerning the many virtues of the medieval Church.
But Brittany is not the only place where this species of
terrorism was in vogue, and that until comparatively
recent times. The writer can recall such descriptions
as this emanating from the pulpits of churches in
Scottish villages only some thirty years ago, and the
strange thing is that people of that generation were
wont to look back with longing and admiration upon
the old style of condemnatory sermon, and to criticize
the efforts of the younger school of ministers as being
wanting in force and lacking the spirit of menace so
characteristic of their forerunners. There are no such
sermons nowadays, they say. Let us thank God that
to the credit of human intelligence and human pity
there are not!</p>
<p>The opposite to this picture is provided by the ballad
on Heaven. It is generally attributed to Michel de
Kerodern, a Breton missionary of the seventeenth
century, but others claim its authorship for St HervÃ©,
to whom we have already alluded. In any case it is as
replete with superstitions as its darker fellow. The
soul, it says, passes the moon, sun, and stars on its
Heavenward way, and from that height turns its eyes
on its native land of Brittany. &ldquo;Adieu to thee, my
country! Adieu to thee, world of suffering and dolorous
burdens! Farewell, poverty, affliction, trouble, and sin!
Like a lost vessel the body lies below, but wherever I
turn my eyes my heart is filled with a thousand felicities.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
I behold the gates of Paradise open at my approach
and the saints coming out to receive me. I am received
in the Palace of the Trinity, in the midst of honours and
heavenly harmonies. The Lord places on my head a
beautiful crown and bids me enter into the treasures
of Heaven. Legions of archangels chant the praise of
God, each with a harp in his hand. I meet my father,
my mother, my brothers, the men of my country.
Choirs of little angels fly hither and thither over our
heads like flocks of birds. Oh, happiness without equal!
When I think of such bliss to be, it consoles my heart
for the pains of this life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The writer&rsquo;s experience is that unlettered British folk often possess
much better information concerning the antiquities of a district than
its &lsquo;educated&rsquo; inhabitants. If this information is not scientific it is
full and displays deep personal interest.</p>

<p>VillemarquÃ© avouches that this version was taken down by his
mother from the lips of an old peasant woman of the parish of NÃ©vez.
It bears the stamp of ballad poetry, and as it has parallels in the folk-verse
of other countries I see no reason to question its genuineness.</p>
